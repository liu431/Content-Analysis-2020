Oh oh.

I had read the reviews and recall some reviewer saying his was defective. Oh no! Mine too? I flipped over the keyboard and realized I hadn't removed the cardboard from the battery compartment. I make absurd mistakes like this often, and I'm a techi, too.

Anyway, I've tested every key and looked at every option, and right this minute I'm typing away on the new keyboard. It not only works, it works as one would expect it to: keys are responsive to just the right amount of pressure and nothing sticks. And the mouse is very responsive to movement. The scroll button works as well. I am up and running and frankly quite satisfied.

This wireless combo hasn't a lot of bells and whistles but it does everything I want from a wireless combo and it's an excellent product for the price.",It does everything it's supposed to and at half the price.,1372032000,

I already had a mouse so I didn't need the mouse that was included but the keyboard is very nice. All I had to do was plug the USB dongle into my desktop and it started working. There was no drivers to install and all the hotkey's worked without having to program the keys. The feel of this keyboard is nice and it seems very durable. I wished I got it earlier bc the one I had before had a stupid cord sticking out in the middle of the keyboard and was annoying. Now, I have to make sure that no one steals this keyboard from my office. There is a lock on my door so I don't think anyone will steal it but I have my concerns. Anyways, the keyboard feels nice and at the price point, I really can't complain. Everything works well and although it's a cheap keyboard it works and the keys feel nice. I have no complaints about this keyboard but I have to get used to using something new again. It's the first wireless keyboard I've ever had and it seems to be working just fine. I do a lot of typing at work so I'm glad I got this keyboard and I'm thinking of buying another one for my home computer.

After 2 weeks- This keyboard is holding up really well. I have it connected to my MS Surface Dock and the mouse and the keyboard works perfectly but since I have the Surface Pro I use the Surface Arch Mouse. The keyboard works well with all window's devices and the shortcuts work without having to programming it in the settings. I have a perfect setup at home. 3 monitors and a wireless keyboard and mouse. Couldn't be better. I like how this keyboard types and the feedback that you get from typing on this keyboard. For the price, I ended up buying 3 of them. One for me at work, one for my wife and one for my work desktop setup.",Nice Keyboard! Easy installation!,1528934400,

The not-so-good news:  It's in the trash and I am looking for a more robust product.  I had a wacky issue with radio frequency interference (RFI), particularly around 18MHz (17 meters).  My computer went ""crazy.""  K1EL keyer was wacky.  Garbage CW being sent.  Cursor jumping all over the place.  I used chokes -- a ton of 'em -- even though I did not have a lot of hope.  THis afternoon I spent more time thinking about potential causes of the RFI issue.  I disconnected the Logitech TX/RX thingie and turned the keyboard and mouse off.  I connected a cheap-o keyboard and a HP-branded mouse and PRESTO!  No more RFI.  This junk product caused me many hours of frustration and I spent many more hours trying to identify the cause of the debilitating RFI issue.

Conclusion:  The Logitech product is poorly designed and *not shielded from RFI.*  If you are a home user and you really don't care if this ""kit"" works for you you will rate this product five stars!  Good for you!

This product provided an excellent solution for a clutter-free, versatile desk. I can quickly move the keyboard and/or the mouse to maximize desk space without needing to worry about the cords.

The keyboard has a simple, standard 104-key layout with 8 hotkeys on the top. The on/off switch is easily accessible on the top right of the keyboard. The mouse provides a basic option for standard computer use. The mouse also has a compartment near the battery to store the USB dongle, which is great for putting the equipment away and not losing track of everything.

For the price, this is a good set-up. My primary complaint is that the advertised range seems a bit off. While they state the keyboard and mouse will work 10-meters away (less if you factor in environmental disturbances), I have found that the keyboard tends to have issues if not closer. I have opted to place my dongle in the USB hub next to my monitor, as I was encountering issues with the connectivity of the keyboard when I was using the USB ports on my tower (approximately 5 feet from the keyboard). While this isn't a huge problem, my tower is not enclosed, so I didn't expect to have these issues (and I tried both on the back and the front, which has a more or less direct line of sight from the keyboard). If you have USB ports on your monitor, that may present another useful option.

I love the keyboard a lot! The keys press down easily, it's not super loud either. I like a basic, simple keyboard without all the flash, buttons and ergonomics of some of the more expensive models - so this was just right for me. I do miss some of the LED lights for Num Lock and Caps Lock, but I'll get over that.

The keyboard hasn't missed a character yet either. I specifically chose this model, because I personally hate Bluetooth, and I was wanting to try the 2.4GHz connection instead. Not disappointed at all!

Now, the reason for 3 stars, is the mouse. The M185 mouse is not very good. I had to set the pointer speed to the 3rd from the slowest setting which is a little slower than I like, but any faster and even the slightest movement, especially when clicking, would make the mouse jump around a bit too much. It made it very difficult to click on smaller buttons and such. My mouse requires a lot of clicking, so I'm sure it's going to annoy me more and more.

I installed the Logitech PointSet and Logitech Options software's, but they made no difference - so I got rid of them. Pointless software IMHO, especially for this basic set on Windows 10. And why are both of the software packages ~100MB? Come on - that seems absurdly large for controlling a mouse and keyboard...

Anyways, I'll deal with the mouse for a while, but I will more than likely be replacing it with a better model in the future. But I hope the keyboard lasts me a good, long time.

So I get these in and I am stoked. No more wires. No more clutter on the work desk.

Alas, these tend to lag a bit. I am sure that is a function of the WiFi in my house but I am sitting not even four feet away from the Modem-Router. And the PC receiver is about three feet from me, plugged into the desktop's USB panel.

Could also be the PC, which is slowing down in its old age.

The lag is not persistent, rather, it is intermittent. So I am going to make some changes and then report back. If it turns out to be my system at fault (as I suspect it is) I will advise.

The FOUR STAR rating, however, is not over the lagging issues, as I am not holding that against Logitech at this time.

Even though I got the Mac Mini for 1/2 off (or maybe even a bigger discount) what its selling for retail, or even what its selling for used on eBay, it did NOT include a keyboard or mouse. So I had to buy that separately, and obviously I needed it to be Mac compatible. But I also did NOT want to spend the $50 or $100 each on a mouse and keyboard, to get the Apple-brand versions. So when I came across this listing and some of the questions and reviews said it worked with their Mac (while, admittedly, others said it didn't) since the price was within my range, AND included the mouse, I decided to take a chance, and bought it.

But I made a BIG mistake!

When I got this keyboard & mouse duo, I plugged in the Mac Mini, connected it to the monitor display (my Sony Bravia TV, actually!) and put the USB dongle for this wireless keyboard & mouse into the USB port and turned on the Mac Mini. It was my first time using my Mac Mini (since I was waiting to get the keyboard and mouse before using it) and when I turned it on, it powered up, and started to load, and the mouse seemed to be working fine (because I was able to move the mouse's cursor around) but as soon as the desktop loaded up, I got an error message saying that the keyboard could not be detected or was not recognized or something and the next thing I knew, the screen suddenly went dark, and the Mac Mini shut off. When I tried to turn it back on, it would make a loud humming noise and on the screen would be the ""banned"" sign (ya know, the circle with a line through it?) before it would shut off again. When I took out the Logitech USB dongle, and waited a while before turning my Mac Mini back on, it started loading up, so I think its this keyboard & mouse that's the problem. Although I don't know it for a fact, I'm not taking a chance with it wrecking my Mac Mini, and so, I'm returning it, and looking for another keyboard and mouse that I can use with my Mac Mini.

Very disappointing!!

I installed the unit on a Windows Pro (Version 1709 build 16299.248) desktop computer, using a USB 2 port.  It was absolutely plug 'n play.

The top row of dedicated keys (volume, home, mail, sleep, calculator) all work w/o issues - although if you have an app in full screen mode and press the calculator button the calc app opens but doesn't pop into view in front of the open app.  YMMV.

The CapsLock has an indicator light, but the NumLock doesn't.  That's a downstroke in my book, but YMMV.  A light is important to me, may not be for you.

Key response on the keyboard isn't bad at all (although that sort of thing is very subjective).  There's a nice tapping sound which I like but if you're in a quiet environment it may not be the best feature.  Keys are not too close together for my medium sized fingers, and touch typing is a breeze.

The mouse works well except that it's a little ""twitchy"" no matter how I set the controls in Win10.  It seems to be either too fast or a bit too slow - probably more of a function of the operating system and not the mouse hardware, but in my Logitech mouse there's a noticeable difference in the mouse movement vs. using a standard USB cabled mouse.  YMMV.  I initially had some teething problems with left clicking, but that sorted itself out with time.  It's a bit different than my old USB mouse in feel and action.

For the price point this is a nicely done keyboard & mouse setup - but for 5 stars I'd really want to see a light for the NumLock.

I use it about 6-8 feet away from my computer when I'm using my TV as a screen. With the receiver on the back of my desktop computer, it was too far and the mouse and keyboard didn't work.

I also have an M510 that gets much better range and I can use the receiver on the rear USB from the same distance.

I struggled with keeping or returning it, but decided to keep it because I had gotten nearly 50% off for a Black Friday special. At regular price, I would have returned it for sure though and waited a better model to come on sale. I wouldn't use the keyboard as my main because it doesn't have a wrist rest that I have become so accustomed to.

3229201,1.0,3,True,"12 1, 2017",A3FMXMYTFF8S4O,B00BP5KOPA,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},Ewan C,"I ordered this keyboard to replace an aging K270. I'm a video game developer and computer consultant so I need a rock solid keyboard, which is why I choose Logitech devices knowing they are solid, even at the budget level. Ive ordered this model before from a different site, and have had no problems, so when the old one started to ware out, I chose the same one. Ive had nothing but problems with the new one.

Its weird. This new one won't work with the old ones receiver. The problem is, it doesn't have the orange gear logo on the bottom, showing that its part of the Unifying ""universal wireless system"". When I try to connect to it with my Unifying receiver using the special compatibility software, its detected as M510 mouse and then fails to install. The problem here is I cant use my better Logitech mouse or any other Unifying devices with the K270, or I will need to use 2 receivers, and I don't have any open USB ports, plus there's potential radio interference. I ended up having to ditch my other unifying devices and use the compact mouse it came with.

As if that weren't bad enough; it has a horrible lag between key-press and screen input, making it impossible to write with for any amount of time (writing this took some patience). Here's an example; Ill be playing a shooter game and all the sudden the W key stops working and I stop moving forward. I try to hit the escape key, nothing. Then 10 seconds later it escapes. This bug pretty much indicates to me that its a counterfeit or at least an inferior transmitter.

Its not the receiver, because Ive had no problems with the M185 mouse. I have full use of the mouse - to open a virtual keyboard and finish typing one click at a time. Its detected by the Unifying software even without the orange Unifying logo and never misses a beat with the new KB and receiver. I would notice any slight stutter in the mouse pointer.  Its compact size is small for my hands and has a loud click, which is bad for in the living room. One other confusing thing: Its labeled MK270 on the box; so shouldn't the mouse be a M270 rather than M185?  No such item exists.

Why would they make 2 different versions of the same model? The only indication that its not the same is on the back and in 2mm fine print where its labeled K270 and below M/N: Y-R0042. My old one is a K270 but M/N: Y-R0015. Ive read in the Q&A; someone returned their Y-R0042 and got the Y-R0015 as a replacement.

The main point here: unless you want to risk receiving the incompatible and buggy version, don't try this product.",Not a Unifying devaice and very buggy.,1512086400,

I purchased this through my fathers account because he has prime, I am reviewing on my account. I  have only had this keyboard and mouse combo for one day so I will tell you about its features and functionality.  I cant discuss longevity obviously.

Info regarding product:

+ There IS a light that lights up when caps lock is pressed, there is NOT a light when the numlock is pressed, however there is a very nice quality screen overlay that can be turned on and off for five functions separately. the function that the overlay will display are CAPS LOCK,SCROLL LOCK, NUM LOCK, INSERT, AND WINDOWS START KEY. you also have the option of playing a ""ding"" sound when a overlay button is pressed or you may use overlay without the sound.
+ The overlay is high quality not like the cheap old monitors with the very basic bright green low res overlay, this one is a grey background with white icon or words. The resolution is high enough that there is no jagged lines, and looks very professional and refined. defiantly looks great on very new computers.
+ There are three programmable buttons, MY HOME, EMAIL, and CALCULATOR.  they can be used to do anything from opening programs to application switching or just keystroke if you want.
+ There is dedicated vol up, vol down, mute, play/pause, home, email, pc power, and calculator buttons.
+ I would like to say the keyboard is much quieter than my last two keyboards and the keys have such a comfortable press to them.
+ Both the keyboard and mouse come with batteries installed!!!
+/- the only thing i don't really care for is that there is a dedicated button for pc power. on my machine it puts it into sleep mode so no big deal. I have not pushed it accidentally. but I just prefer to use the OS to shutdown or restart.
-/+ it IS true that this keyboard DOES NOT connect to the ""unifying"" logitech usb dongle! HOWEVER (My opinion here) SO WHAT! this keyboard and mouse combination is 12 dollars right now! my computer has 6 usb ports in the back and 2 in the front, I am seriously not upset that I need to have a dongle specifically for this set, especially when this price it this comfortable. (BTW a replacment unifying dongle costs more than this keyboard and mouse set)

I have not used the mouse, i don't need it i am sorry i have very little info about it, heres what i know:

It has left and right mouse buttons. The scroll wheel also can be pushed for center click. it has a on/off switch. its kinda small for my hand, it remind me of a laptop mouse. the model number of the muse is M185.

I cant belive all these features are included in this basic set. I would guess that everyone wants the unifying dongles now days and that is why these are on such a closeout price. I recommend you put some serious thought into the advantages of the unifying reciever beacause for most people there will be none. I am VERY happy with it,  I have been using logitech products for more than 10 years and they all have worked exceptionally. I will however update this review if i have issues in the future.",Fantastic! i am very pleased,1511654400,

Register III,"I work in IT and supplied about twenty users in my office with the Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse combo. All-in-all we could say this is a great keyboard for the ease-of-use, performance, battery life, cost, and design. However it has proven to be faulty and Logitech has not provided adequate support.

To exaggerate on my claim that it is faulty, I need to explain that the mouse appears fault-free, and the keyboard works fine for the majority of the time. The problem is that the keyboard will inconsistently and sporadically miss keystrokes, or lose connection, or add too many keystrokes. It may do this in spurts, or it will have a streak and do it consistently for a period of time. I have not had these kinds of problems with similar Logitech wireless keyboards in the same office. I have tried various troubleshooting steps (yes, and replaced the batteries) but this is occurring on multiple different computer models with this same keyboard model. Some users noted that in some instances they can restore functionality by turning the keyboard off and on again, or if that doesn't work then (literally) slamming the keyboard down on the desk will resolve problems for up to a few days at a time; or a few minutes depending on the case.

I reached out to Logitech support by two methods: First by chat window, but in both of two instances the tech representative took too long to respond to me and the window timed out, kicked me out of the chat, and gave me a notification that 'I took too long to respond' and that's why it closed. Then I emailed them about both the keyboard and the chat problem. About a week later I received the first of three emails, stating that they've notified the tech representative handling my case. The second email came a few days later requesting technical diagnostics. When I responded with the requested data I received a reply soon thereafter saying that a higher-level tech has been tasked with my data. That's the last email I received -- it's been two weeks beyond that. One week ago I sent an inquiry about the case and never heard back; I also asked them to replace the faulty keyboard with a different model.

Plug in the usb dongle, remove the little tags from the surprise included batteries, turn them on and your set!! (On windows 10 at least).

Now don't go buying this thinking its indestructable, Can pretty much assure you it has a weakness, they all do, my kids just haven't found it yet!

Im not a power user or super gamer so did not need all the programable buttons and whatnot some of the more costly models include. But I am a cordcutter and my PC is mostly used for tv and movies.

We have three of these.
They work wonderfully so long as the receiver is mounted in close proximity and in direct line-of-sight to the keyboard; if it is not, then it will skip letters and often lag --- as in letters typed will not appear for a few seconds.
If you plug the receiver directly into a desktop port, without a clear unobstructed line-of-sight, sooner or later you are going to be disappointed.
However, THERE IS A FIX --- get a long USB extension cable and plug the receiver into that, placing the receiver in close proximity and direct line-of-sight to the keyboard.
Logitech knows of this and by rights should include a USB extension cable in the box, or at the least advise people that they will need one.
The mouse, however, seems to be immune to this signal loss problem and will work through walls and over long distances and never miss a beat.

The newer keyboards usually are not deep, and since I type and transcribe audio and touch type, this is a must have for me. This keyboard definitely meets my needs. I also like the ""snap"" response of the keys as you type.  The keyboard and mouse come with batteries, and I think that's a nice plus. Additionally the keyboard has a separate numeric keypad to the right. Spatially speaking the keyboard is a nice full size keyboard without taking up a lot of desk space. The multimedia keys across the top of the keyboard are ready to use right out the box. I am using a Razer Pro laptop (PC) Windows 10. All of the shortcuts work well. Lastly, The keyboard has two kickstands at the top of the keyboard underneath it to allow you to adjust angle for comfort.

Potential Cons....If I were going to provide some cons, it would be only a minor list that is certainly not enough to return the unit (I purchased it on Prime Day for $12.50 and free shipping. Definitely a keeper!). Anyway, there are virtually no printed directions outside of what's provided ON the box itself. So, if you're typically one to quickly discard the box after opening....definitely don't do it with this. The instructions are located on the inner flap where the mouse is located. Another con is that if you are moving too quickly, you might miss the USB receiver tucked into the cardboard on the inner flap near the instructions (see pictures). I would have preferred a USB receiver that tucks into the mouse in a small compartment. This lets me know that this item really wasn't meant for mobility or temporary/shared office spaces. The USB receiver is small and definitely easy ""leave"" or lose by mistake. Another issue is that there is an on off button. So, when the keyboard is in the on position, it did not tell

Fortunately for me, I purchased this unit to build out my home office. So, it won't be traveling with me ever. I use my Microsoft Arc Mouse for that. Finally my last con is that there is a small leaflet included in the packaging. I think that it is INSTRUCTIONS but no such luck....it's the warranty, safety, and compliance information in about 4 languages. I personally would have preferred the instructions.

This was a 2017 Prime Day purchase because it was a good deal. My last Logitech mouse was garbage and would not stay connected. I hoped that I might have better luck with a matched keyboard and mouse, so far so good!

I've had it 3 days and no drop outs or problems, slight lag on occasion, but I blame that more on my desk and particular setup. The receiver could not be any closer since my computer sits ON my desk, so I don't expect any signal loss.

If it starts to act up, I'll post an update.

I'm using it as a simple K/M to use from machine to machine support. Got it at a great price in the Prime deal sale. Could not pass up! Both devices had batteries installed, so pulling a simple tab activated them. That was a nice touch! Literally pulled them out of the box, out of their plastic wrap, pulled the tab, plugged the USB wireless interface into a PC, and everything just worked. Both units have an on/off switch which is perfect for me since I'm using these periodically and will help with battery life if you switch them off when not in use for prolonged periods. Mouse uses only one AA batter, which is a little odd but works fine. The keyboard uses two AAs. I did not test range, but it worked without issue from about a meter in my testing. The keyboard has some dedicated multimedia function over the function keys which was also welcome. There is a Caps Lock light but no NumLock light. That is bad oversight! I can understand no SrollLock loght, but NumLock ... come on! Keyboard definitely feels membrane mushy but has reasonable travel and fair resistance.

Nice compact footprint, full size function. I am able to slide this into a a rolling laptop case and a shoulder strap 17"" laptop bag (which I prefer for 14"" - 15.6""  laptops. I like it, but it has two quirks which prevent me from giving it five stars:
1. No Num Lock indicator (it does have Cap lock light). (minus one star) I have no idea why the Numb-Nuts Numb-Skull product engineer at Logitech is anti-Num-Lock light.  It was easy enough for them to give it a Caps Lock light, why not Num-Lock light, too? This can present an unnecessary difficulty on start-up when you need to enter a password containing numbers before you can even see the on-screen indicator for this keyboard function. I am not always able to set Num Lock ON at startup on employer based machines where I do not have admin rights. See photo below which shows the $10 (at Wal-store) K120 wired KB with three lights, and this K270 with only one: Why does a cheaper keyboard get three lights, but the wireless set only gets ONE???
2. It has a PC Off button right above the F8 key (photo below) that is WAY TOO EASY to accidentally touch. (minus another star) I use this on my couch, with a laptop plugged in to a big screen TV, and often, I grab the keyboard above the F keys, (there is not much keyboard to grab onto) and accidentally shut down my laptop. The same button will NOT turn it back on.
In summary, this is not the wireless desktop I want for work, although I can ""make-do"" and work around the Num-Lock indicator deficiency, by logging in through the laptop keyboard. But, I gave up on it for couch duty, due to the #2 above.
Update1: I now work in a desk Hotel-ing"" arrangement, where I do not leave things from day-to day.  This keyboard and mouse are good for this because they fit (more-or-less) in my rolling bag.  The keyboard sticks out the top near the handle, which is OK. The power-off button, which is a problem for couch duty, has never been an issue at work.  Also, it has not been an issue in my home office which is similar to work. So I am changing to 4 star, BUT I still hate the lack of the Num-lock indicator light, and keep a K120 wired keyboard around at all times.
Update2: I had left this behind a seat, on the floor-boards of my Toyota, parked outdoors during winter in California. At least one sunny day caused heat in the closed car and this product warped so badly as to freeze keys and no longer be usable.

3229534,4.0,2,True,"06 17, 2017",ARNWCQZHZWKW8,B00BP5KOPA,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},Walter Luffman,"This is my second MK270 keyboard-mouse combo; I use them with a laptop computer because I prefer a ""desktop"" keyboard and mouse when I travel.  Why did I buy a second combo? I lost the battery-compartment covers to both keyboard and mouse during my travels, and this is my main reason for subtracting one star.  (A tip: tape the covers in place before you pack these for a trip.)

The full-size keyboard (including number-pad) is of the membrane variety with rubber domes under the keycaps; this is the type that is common with all desktop computers sold these days.  The key travel is delightfully longer and more positive-feeling than on my laptop's keyboard, and my first MK270 still works beautifully after three years of daily use -- except the batteries now fall out when I'm traveling. :)  The keycaps are sculpted, much like those on better mechanical keyboards, and the markings (letters, numbers, special characters) show no sign of fading or wearing away.  I think I'll keep this keyboard around as a spare for use on my two desktop computers, or maybe as a keycap-donor.  While it isn't quite as comfortable as a good mechanical keyboard, it's close enough that I can switch back and forth without problems.

The mouse uses an optical (but not laser) sensor, which is certainly more than adequate for general use.  It's also slightly smaller than the average mouse, which makes it easier to fit into a pocket in my laptop case -- but not so small that using it becomes a problem for my average-size-male hands.

Battery life with both components is pretty good.  Even though I almost never remember to turn them off, the batteries (2 AAA alkalines for the keyboard, 1 AA alkaline for the mouse) generally last far longer than I would have expected.  I usually replace all three every nine to twelve months whether they need it or not.

The USB receiver for both components is tiny; I usually leave it plugged in, and the laptop will still fit into a reasonably snug-fitting case or sleeve.  But there is a storage compartment in the mouse -- a nice touch on Logitech's part.

The combo does not come with a driver disk, and you should not need one for basic operation under either Windows or Linux.  But software to access the additional feature-keys at the top of the keyboard is available for download from Logitech.

This combo would not my first choice for someone who programs or pounds out long documents on a daily basis -- for that I prefer a (wired) mechanical keyboard and trackball connected to a more powerful desktop computer.  Nor do I expect it would be a great choice for a serious gamer.  But for casual or occasional use, it's certainly more than adequate, including a keyboard-feel that is close enough to an electric typewriter to please most users.  And for the price, I consider it a genuine bargain.  Logitech sells a lot of these, and I see them in big-box stores all the time, so others must agree that it's a pretty good deal.

If you are a casual computer user, or if you actually prefer the rubber-dome membrane keyswitches, I think you'll like this Logitech keyboard-mouse combo.  in the bargain you'll eliminate a couple of cables running across your desk, and free up one USB port on your computer.","Excellent, for what it is",1497657600,

3229569,5.0,,True,"05 23, 2017",A1968A7LAEKIEN,B00BP5KOPA,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},Alison G.,"The mouse is a little smaller than I had anticipated, but going from a full size to a more travel size hasn't been an issue. It still fits well enough in my hand, and it works splendidly, even with my old computer. I needed a new set when my old Logitech bluetooth finally gave out, and decided to stick with the brand that works.

I'm glad my loyalty was rewarded! Logitech has stepped up their game since my last keyboard set. Now I can easily see when the keyboard is on or off, rather than having to pick it up and look for the tiny switch hidden away underneath. There's a visible light for caps lock, so I don't give someone a surprise through a quickly typed and entered instant message.

Better yet, there's a whole row of interesting buttons at the top. Granted, I won't use quite a bit of them, but having access to the volume and power functions of my computer in a very out-of-the way place makes it much easier. I usually plug my laptop into a projector for movie nights, and it can be a pain to get up, find the laptop in the dark, and putter around with finding the next movie. Having a keyboard and mouse set that's not wired in means I can be anywhere in my living room and won't have to get up in between films. And if I just so happen to decide to just sleep on the couch, I still won't have to get up to turn off the computer. But, since the buttons are on a dedicated row fully separated from the rest of the keys, it severely limits the chance of you accidentally hitting a button you didn't want.

The mouse is extremely responsive (too much at times, personally), but the pointer speed can easily be fixed. There are some drivers that are recommended to download, and I say download whichever ones you find. The ones that automatically downloaded when I plugged in the keyboard were well enough, and I could still do everything I needed to with this product, but the accessory driver on Logitech's website gave a nice interface for me to interact with the keyboard and mouse. With that I was able to play around with a couple of personalizations I didn't even know I could do, and this keyboard is more attuned to my needs.

If you're looking for a blend of quality and price, Logitech's lower level keyboards are definitely the way to go. Unless you're a big gamer, or use the keyboard extensively, there's not much of a need to upgrade from this product.","Works great, and upholds to heavy daily use",1495497600,

I have one tip to mention though.  I have total of 3 of these and two of them experienced intermittent problem of keyboard not working.  I type something and no response.  I type again and input starts somewhere in the middle.  Problem was the placement of receiver module.  I had to move it from back of the PC to front.  Now it works reliably.  Another is connected to a PC behind my TV.  I rigged up an extension cable for USB and dangled it, then attached a receiver.  Now it's in clear view.  Again, it works well now.

I'm guessing transmit power of the keyboard is rather low.  So I had to make sure both are in line of sight - sort of.  2.4Ghz will go through wood desk just fine, but anything metal will obscure it, including it being behind a PC.

I was sitting rather far away (approx 8 ft from PC, PC hooked up to big tv) so I figured distance was the reason. I moved closer and sure enough everything worked fine, but it wasn't a permanent solution. I grabbed a USB extension cable, plugged that into the PC then plugged the little USB receiver for the keyboard/mouse to that. I was able to run that cord to my tv stand so the USB receiver for the keyboard/mouse sits there kind of like an Xbox kinect or Wii sensor. Thank god for USB extension cables!

Pros: Lightweight. On/Off switch on keyboard and mouse. Both use AA or AAA batteries. No setup or advanced install required.

The MK270 keyboard/mouse combo came two ways, as others have said.  The earlier versions were independent (two chips for mouse and keyboard, so two tied-up USB ports), while later versions worked with the unifying chip, so you only use one USB port for both devices.  Another problem, however, seems that the newer unified units have a bad drop-out problem, where they lose sync. This is NOT UNUSUAL, as Logitech never really perfected their 'wi-fi unifying chip' that well. Windows fights with it, but make no mistake about it, THERE IS NO LINUX SYSTEM THAT FUNCTIONS WITH THE LOGITECH UNIFYING RECEIVER!

I've always used Logitech wireless keyboard/mouse combos in multiple styles (raised keys, flat keys, more spread out or closer together, etc) and loved them all - 5 stars for sure, for every one! This is the very first I haven't liked, and the fact that it is SO bad in comparison to all other Logitech keyboards makes it extra annoying.

The overall look is very dated. Newer Logitechs are sleeker but this one has the squared, raised, keys typical of the very first keyboards. The pic of the product being all black is incorrect; the top buttons (volume, home, etc) are dark grey.

But my real complaint about this keyboard is it's function. At first I thought the problem was that I was going from a Logitech with almost flush keys to a Logitech with basically old school word processor type keys, and their overbearing bulkiness was just causing me to accidentally hit keys I didn't mean to with the edges of my fingers. So I started being exceptionally careful, becasue I could type a whole paragraph and in the middle of typing it would highlight and disappear without a trace. Once in a while? Okay, it happens. Every single time you type? The keyboard is poorly designed. Then I noticed that there was another highlight/erase quirk - if I highlighted a sentence to delete, the second I let my finger up off the mouse half the paragraph highlights, and what's really infuriating is that the part I actually highlighted originally will usually be the only part that ISN'T highlighted. I understand this sounds like user error, and I kept trying to chalk it up to that, but again, happening a few times I can see, happening literally constantly every time you are on the computer is some kind of straight up bad product functionality and design.

That being said, it works like a charm, just like any other logitech wireless keyboard. I use it on a daily basis, 8-10 hours a day (8 staright hours at work, and sometimes a couple extra hours on personal usage), and never experience any issue. I always have my laptop connected to both, this mk270, and a k400 plus (Also from logitech, awesome keyboard by the way, definitively not for work, as it's not full-size keyboard...), and both of them work great; I even  switch back and forth multiple times a day with no problem at all. Always responsive, no lag at all, no connectivity issues.
Plug and play: Just connect and start using, almost like a wired keyboard. However, that's the main reason I deducted 1 star. As it's not unifying-compatible, it reqires an available usb port for itself, which in my case, was a HUGE dissapointment, as I have only 3 usb ports on my laptop. I had this exact same keybaord (Same model) since 2012, but broke it while moving, back on December 2016. That one was unifying compatible, so I used one single receiver for both of my logitech keyboards, and could even manage them via the optional logitech software, with different customizing options and stuff. This one I bought on 2017, is NOT compatible with any of that. No wireless unifyng technology here, which makes no sense if you ask me. Why in the world would you make an exact same version of this great product without unifying technology??? And even worse, why would you name it exactly the same (mk270)??

Its a really cheap feeling keyboard. super light-weight but feels like cheap, brittle plastic and sounds like it when I type. Its not loud, but sounds just like you imagine plastic tapping on plastic sounds. That being said the keys are pretty responsive. If you don't care how it ""feels"" or how it sounds, or where the buttons are you might love it.

Sometimes I think there are gangs of trolls plasterinf this site with positive reviews, hired by the companies -- including this one-- that market stuff here.  I have used three of these ""things"" in my office over the course of the past month. My boss bought them, not me.  He got hoodwinked by a salesman at a local ""superstore"" who said that the reason it was running poorly was that my NEW Lenovo computer was loaded with malware. What a liar.  Absolutely false and my boss  swallowed it hook line and sinker.  Our highly experienced computer tech checked the hard drive thoroughly when he installed it 3 weeks ago, I have run malware bytes and nothing comes up and I do not download crap from the internet.  I had this stinking hunk of useless plastic placed about two feet from my computer, so it's not a question of excessive range.  When I typed into Word, it would initially be okay, but within a couple of hours and often less, the keyboard would stop responding to typing. When it actually did work,  It would often stop registering key strokes on a 5-10 second delay or more.  I found (out of frustration) that the only way to get it to react when this occurred was to whack the hell out of it.  That's probably its best feature.  I could pound the hell out of it and it  remained intact, no loose or lost keys, etc.  When I smacked it, it  would suddenly dump a whole bunch of characters into the document, some I previously typed and some that got registered by the side of my fist.  The mouse is the same.  In the middle of typing a document, the cursor would get lost.  Swinging the thing across my desk a few times would often get the cursor to appear again, but often the only way to get it to work was to smack it smartly onto a solid surface or pound the top of it with the side of my fist.  In short, I would suggest that if you plan to get a wireless combo, look elsewhere.  Maybe this works for some, but certainly none of the three in succession I had the misfortune to have to use before my boss wised up.  I will personally avoid buying logitech products forever after this total fiasco.  I now hate this company with deep passion.  This company is the Ford (fix or repair daily) of computer equipment, except you can't fix it.

This is NOT one. This item has a separate wireless dongle that ONLY works with the two devices (keyboard and mouse) in the package. I was shopping for a replacement to my previous K800 when this was suggested in the alternatives. This is all the more confusing because there is a MK270 keyboard available with the unifying receiver. Today after several delivery delays I find out that this product is the wifi only version.

Note in the image the dongle that came with this product (right) does not have the orange Unifying symbol (left) that my other products' USB adapters all have.

One of my concerns was that there was no CapsLock or NumLock light indicators which is really important for work for me, but if you go to the Logitech website you can download drivers that will give you on-screen indicators of what mode you're in.

The quick-pick volume buttons are convenient, the Home button brings up an internet browser, I need to figure out how to tie the email button to my outlook account, calculator button works, and I don't want to try to power button yet. :-P

One unexpected bonus feature is that this keyboard seems to be quieter than my last one.

So far so good; but I've only had it a few days.  I'll try to remember to update in a few months about general performance and battery life.

EDIT: July 5, 2017

Promised an update on battery life and performance and my batteries just died so here I am.  Bought the keyboard in early/mid February 2017 and batteries lasted through the month of June so that's roughly 5-1/2 months of life assuming you use your keyboard pretty much all day everyday.  I don't do heavy typing all the time but I use the keyboard shortcuts in AutoCAD and I'm on AutoCAD the majority of my day so judge your own potential battery life accordingly.

The only notable complaint that I have is that every once in a while I'll lose connectivity on the keyboard - just the keyboard, not the mouse, too.  I don't know what that's to do with exactly but it will eventually (within minutes) right itself and I'll carry on with my day, but note that this has been an occassional issue for me so it's something a potential buyer should be aware of.  If it goes on for a long time I toggle the on-off switch and it seems to restore it. :shrug:

I'm starting to wear bald spots in the soft texture of the keys (specifically, Space Bar, ESC, Enter and F (?)) which is to be expected with use and time but I have not begun to lose any letters.","Simple, no-frills wireless keyboard EDIT: Has held up well",1486944000,

The keyboard is very responsive and feels great to use, and the mouse is a great addition as well with its amazing DPI. All of these pros combined with the insane battery life of this keyboard and mouse makes for a very high-quality product.

While its not the best buy for someone whos looking to extensively game on it, its a very versatile mobile mouse and keyboard that more than makes up for its downfalls with an insanely affordable price. If you're looking for a deal, then you won't find a better one then the Logitech MK270.

Portable and Plug and Play
At just over a pound, the Logitech MK270 Wireless Combo includes a keyboard and mouse that incorporates the same reliable 2.4 GHz connectivity that eliminates delays, dropouts, and interference with a 30-foot range of motion. What comes in the box is a full-size spill-resistant keyboard, a carry around mouse, a Logitechs Unifying receiver, batteries for mouse and keyboard, and the user documentation. Both devices are plug n play (on Mac, Windows, and Chrome OS), so you can simply plug the low-profile receiver into a free USB port and youll be wirelessly typing and navigating in no time.

Long Battery Life
Both keyboard and mouse are powered by batteries so you can go for months without the hassle of changing batteries. The Logitech MK270 Wireless Combo connects to your PC using Logitechs device-networking receiver that allows you to sync your keyboard and up to five additional compatible peripherals at once. The computer instantly recognizes both devices using the Unifying receiver without any software installation and allows you to perform basic typing tasks with reliable wireless connectivity.

Great For Workstations
I use a 17 inch Dell workstation, so my laptop isn't exactly the type of gadget to keep on the lap. I was having trouble with all the extensive typing required for my job, so I decided to spend some money on a wireless keyboard. I spent some time researching for a value for money combo and after viewing reviews on MK270 Wireless Keyboard, I decided to go in for a quality brand like Logitech because typing is very important in my job and I didn't want any low-quality product that would eventually give up on me one day.

Build Quality
rsz_102603568_02_222430d3-9249-4b2f-8e26-a8baa12b0dc9

For a full-size desktop keyboard, the MK270 is pretty decent, and it feels light and sturdy in the hands. The keyboard design is spill proof and has multiple drain holes. The keys themselves are low-profile, and it feels good enough to type reasonably fast. After a few days, I was able to get my preferred words per minute without any trouble because the keys have great travel time between keystrokes and they are very quiet and comfortable. The keyboard contains all the standard keys along with a row of eight designated hotkeys at the top edge of the keyboard frame, which gives you one-touch access to your media applications, calculator, internet functions, and PC shutdown. I usually handle most of my devices very roughly, and with all the extensive typing any keyboard suffers serious abuse in my hands. But so far, the keyboard is doing well and providing a decent response.

Logitech MK270s Mouse
rsz_02603568_01_fe5fa250-ae0e-418b-899e-53985bdbce7d

The mouse also provides a decent experience and is a fantastic spare when you need one most. Its lightweight and very accurate for a wireless mouse. It has an ON/OFF switch on the back side and the battery compartment, which uses 1 AA battery, also contains a section to keep your receiver in case you're not using it. The mouse comes with an invisible optic laser that means you cant see the light, which is a bit uncomfortable but it helps to save some battery. But overall, the mouse feels good in the hands and it does the job well, and thats about it.

If you're trying to game with the mk270, then this mouse be a little lacking in features. If you're looking for something to game with, then check out my good cheap gaming mice list.

Other Things I Liked About The MK270
What I really liked about MK270 is that it comes with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-Bit Encryption that guarantees all your private keystrokes protection from evil-doers, which I think is a very good feature because the wireless devices can be easily hacked by experienced hackers nowadays. The company also provides an extra software for button customization for both Windows and Chrome OS but unfortunately not for Mac users.

The company also provides an extra software for button customization for both Windows and Chrome OS but unfortunately not for Mac users. The software is not required for basic functionality but depending on your personal setup, you might want to visit the website for SetPoint that lets you customize F-keys, hotkeys, and even mouse buttons. For such a low price, the MK270 offers a sturdy wireless keyboard that provides an accurate full-sized typing and a decent mouse experience, without the lag and cheap plastic afflicting most wireless keyboards.

Logitech MK270 For Gaming
I know a lot of my readers are gamers, so I think its important to talk about how the Logitech MK270 combo performs when gaming. If I had to give a quick summary, Id say that its good for people whore going to be playing action games with little to no macros needed. If you're looking for something with a significant amount extra buttons to key bind your abilities too, then youll be very disappointed with the MK270.

This combo shines, when you're looking for a wireless plug and play mouse and keyboard thats more spacious than your current setup. If you have a desktop, I wouldnt recommend this for gaming, but If you have a laptop, this could be a great alternative to just using the laptops cramped trackpad and keyboard.",Great Wireless Combo,1484697600,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61TcaMPAO3L._SY88.jpg']

update This is NOT mk270! Mk270 are unifying. this, k270 is not. Imagine my surprise  when I search for a new keyboard and the first one I click on says I bought this same keyboard before. I bought this late 2016. plugged it in to make sure it worked. wrapped it up and gave it to my boyfriend for his birthday. we did not get to hook it up because he died of cancer. needless to says this got put aside and forgotten for over a year. not long ago I came across it again. I needed a keyboard so I hooked it up and hated the mouse that comes with it. no big deal, i decided to just unify it to my better mouse. when it wouldn't connect I turned it over to check manufacturer part number. this is a k270 NOT mk270. i thought I just miss remembered with all that happened.

I tried the on screen keyboard, that was even slower, (I don't have touch screen capabilities,) and finally the voice command interface to find that my microphone was faulty.

The genius idea then occurred to me that I could purchase a separate keyboard.  I couldn't believe that it took me so long to figure that out.  *mega face-palm*  I chose this one because it was wireless and came with a mouse.  The installation was easier than blinking, the batteries were included and I was typing and writing reviews like a crazy woman in minutes.

The mouse is compact without being clumsy small, runs super smooth without being overly sensitive and it reminded me how much I missed the scroll wheel thing.  As for the keyboard, there are feet that flip out for a slight incline for comfort, it is thin and lightweight making it easy to travel with.  The keys are laid out well, they have a satisfying press resistance, (if that makes sense,) and though I will miss the short laptop keys because the don't snag my nails, this was a wonderful $13 dollar solution to a minimum $300 problem brought on by a frustratingly thoughtless moment.

The mouse is not the same as the MK120 mouse its about 1/3 smaller but only from length, the width feels about the same, maybe a bit slimmer but theres no laser light which is awesome so for someone like me who uses my big HDTV as a 2nd monitor in bed i'd have to turn the mouse to keep it from moving and triggering the mouse and UI, this has an off switch as well along with the keyboard. everything else about the mouse is 1:1 with the M120 mouse

The wireless dongle is truly plug and play, I put it into my USB 3.0 slot in Windows 10 and it didn't even notice it and it just works

oh yeah Logitec puts DURACELLS in each which is awesome, most of the time mfg put cheap no-name foreign batteries in their devices so kudos.

bottomline, for roughly the same exact price as the MK120 this is a much better deal.",For just a few bucks more than the wired MK120 its a no brainier.,1474416000,

Plugged the USB receiver into a Nuc6i5 running Windows 10, and it was instantly recognized--it even worked before I unplugged my wired USB keyboard/mouse. I really like the feel of the mouse, and the keyboard has an ""decent"" feel to it (wish it was more rigid). One cool thing that I really like about the keyboard that didn't know it had was the extra keys on the top [above the ""F"" keys) to control VLC (pause/play, mute, volume up/down, etc)!! Since I am using this as a multimedia computer (HTPC) hooked up to a 75"" TV, just having to push pause/play instead of moving the mouse is handy to pause movies/music or quickly mute the volume.  I was also pleasantly surprised the keyboard came with 2 ""AAA"" Duracell batteries, and the mouse with a single ""AA"" Duracell!! Refreshing to see Logitech supply quality batteries with this item!!

Only negative is that neither device has an LED visible to see if the item is on or off.  On the keyboard since the off/on switch is on top it isn't that big of a deal, but having to turn the mouse over to see if it was left on is more of an inconvenience.

The mouse works great, even when the keyboard isn't doing so well.

The fact that the mouse keeps working while the keyboard lags, combined with the observation that the keyboard sometimes gets a lot better after I turn it off/on, leads me to believe that this is most likely not a wireless conflict with my 2.4 Ghz wireless USB interface.

I didn't really like this set much, but I believe it deserves 4 stars at it certainly lived up to its price point. For 20 bucks, its a decent keyboard and mouse combo.
Pros:
-Has an on and off switch to conserve battery
-Easy to repair if keys become detached
- Has a variety of function keys on the top which all work flawlessly on windows 10 with exception to the play pause button, which ive found no use for so far.
-Mouse is small and curves make it easier to grip.
Cons:
-Weak connectivity. After about 1 day of use, the mouse and keyboard will lag in typing and mouse control unless you are right next to the receiver. I suspect this is a result of the 2.5 ghz bands from any wifi network, interferes with the 2.5 ghz bands from this keyboard and mouse causing it to have low performance

3230520,4.0,,False,"08 6, 2016",ARUSEM2EBMGNV,B00BP5KOPA,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},ohGr,"Cons first, because there seems to be some confusion.  I cannot find the Unifying version anywhere, so the item I got was the kb and mouse combo that uses one receiver.  Also the mouse is a M185 and keyboard K270, weird logic to call the set MK270.  No num lock light, which is a major con to me, I need that num lock light for my MMORPG.  Not a slim, I HATE big tall bulky keys.

Pros are it's a sturdy Logitech to start out with.  And however the num lock light doesn't exist, the caps lock light is included (but that's silly, if you type and cannot tell you're in caps, then facepalm yourself now).  No lag so far.  Plug and play.  Even though I hate the key design, I love the actuation / feeling from them, solid, firm, yet easy presses, I do not miss a key when typing fast. Mouse seems to never miss a beat on almost all surfaces.

Middle ground:  I haven't tested range, but with 2.4 and my experience with Logitech it should be fine, the box I got it in advertised 33 feet.  The logo, lol, yes I am being nitpicky, I got the new version with the new grade school looking logo, please don't cheapen your image Logitech, like the Xbox One controller buttons, the logo looks like it was designed for grade schoolers.  Still middle ground, with all the beef about Unifying technology, how many mainstream users actually have a dozen keyboards and mice, all Logitech brand, that they randomly swap out so often?  Is this really a huge issue?  I got exactly what I wanted, a kb mouse combo that uses one usb receiver, for the price if it goes bust, I can buy another combo all together for pete's sake, I mean the people complaining about Unifying obviously have enough money to have spare name brand parts just lying around, it shouldn't be an issue.  Even then, the longevity ""should"" not even make it a concern with this brand.

To sum up, the cons aren't really too much of cons to me besides the exclusion of a num lock light.  The key action makes up for the bulky keys.","solid combo, affordable price.",1470441600,

At the special ""Prime"" day pricing I got, it launches to a full 5-star review!  But for the usual day-to-day price, it's still an excellent keyboard.  I love the extra row of pre-programmed function keys (above the normal [F] keys), such as volume, email, calculator, etc. - VERY handy!

The feel of the keys is excellent.  There is adequate indented rounding of the keys for finger-tips (especially nice for people that touch-type and don't need to look at the keyboard), with quite adequate spacing between keys to limit hitting two keys with one finger stroke.  Actual keystroke is crisp and the sound is somewhat muted (not sounding like cheap plastic hitting cheap plastic, as is often the case with lower priced keyboards).

I also like that they've moved the on-off switch to the top of the board (the one that his replaced, an older Logitech that finally died after many years of great service, had the switch on the bottom).  If you want to conserve battery life, this makes it very easy, as opposed to turning the unit upside down every time you turn it on and off.

The one downside is the mouse.  The LED in it is now infrared, and therefore invisible.  That also means it is impossible to know if it's really on or not.  If the mouse pointer doesn't move, it was always nice to know (with the old mouse) that the battery was or was not still powering the mouse (helps with trouble shooting).  Plus the old mouse had a green light on the top when it was on (turned to red when the battery was low).  This apparently has no low battery warning, and with the invisible LED used for tracking underneath, the user can't tell if it's even powered up.

Still, battery life is advertised as quite good, so it's not a huge problem every several months to just pop in a new battery and see if that solves any mouse problems.

The USB interface has been flawless - just plug it into a USB port, wait just a moment for the computer to recognize it (making sure both keyboard and mouse are turned on of course), and you're ready to go.  There is no ""installation"" other than simply plugging in the very small USB device.

I miss my old wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse combination, but this is a very nice replacement, particularly for the price paid.  Even normal price is quite reasonable for what this provides.

She mostly uses it lightly for general computer stuff, but likes to play overwatch / league maybe a few times a week. We noticed some issues after a week or two, and for a while we thought it was just lag, but they progressively got worse and worse. It's been less than a year, but it looks like we have to replace both the mouse and the keyboard, already.

The mouse will get stuck clicking, even though you let go. Mechanically, it's not ""stuck."" I mean, it releases just like it should, but the computer still registers it as if it's clicking.

The keyboard is the worst part, now. There's a good 5-6 second delay between volume controls sometimes. So you can be gently trying to nudge up the volume during a quiet conversation on Game of Thrones and then BOOM! you're inside of a church bell.

Pretty frequently, (every 3-20 minutes, at random!) the keyboard will just do it's own thing. Characters will just run forward on their own, or ignore commands, and you'll just screw your entire team over. When it happens, all your controls lock up, meaning you can't even hold backwards to keep your character from barreling into death. A lot of users have complained about this issue in other logitech keyboards, but the only options seem to involve fixing LED settings, which this keyboard doesn't have.

Happens mostly in Overwatch, for whatever reason, but also happens less often when running other games or even browsing the web with no other programs running.","Malfunctions with certain games, started to get silly errors within a few weeks, almost unusable less than a year later",1468972800,

I will confirm that mine arrived and is not unifying.  So as others have mentioned, note this if that is a critical thing you are looking for.  I didn't need that feature so it is a moot point for me.

Let's be honest, this is a basic set.  I find that the keyboard is slightly loud but by no means distracting.  It functions perfectly fine and I have not experienced any issues with keys sticking or lacking behind as I type.

The mouse is your typical mouse.  Compared to others I have used the past several years, I'd say it is comparable in size (small but not tiny.)

I tend to be very particular and this has more than met my expectations.  I recently purchased a new desktop for work related use and was surprised to find it came with a wireless keyboard and mouse.  I was even more intrigued by the fact that they both communicated with the desktop tower through one USB dongle.  Sadly I found the mouse that came from HP to be unuseable (it had very sharp edges around the mouse where the top piece separated to allow changing the battery.  I decided that I preferred the overall appearance of having the keyboard and mouse without cables running to the back of my desk but I could not work with a mouse that felt as if it was trying to draw blood from my palm every time I moved the cursor on my screen.
I took a stab at this Logitech set as I had been happy with a few of their products in the past.  Let me say a couple key things:
1)  The keys on the keyboard are quiet to type on, there is little in the way of the plasticy click that can be heard with cheaply made items.
2) The mouse does NOT have any sharp edges and is quite comfortable in a medium sized hand, it is on the smaller side.  Think half way between a full sized Microsoft mouse and a travel laptop mouse.
3)  The battery life is greater than expected.  I have had both items up and running for three weeks.  I have not turned the power switch off on either the keyboard or the mouse and they are running strong.
I originially purchased this set as a trial with the view that I would replace in the future if I found them lacking.  I am going to venture that barring any unforeseen event they will be with me for quite some time to come.",Far better than expected.,1463875200,

- Standard keyboard layout, right down to the menu button on the right side between Alt and Ctrl.  This was my main reason for buying this set.
- Media control buttons up top (I was most concerned about volume, but the other standard controls are there too).
- You can't beat the cost, especially on sale.

Cons:
- Really small mouse - as in it feels like they took a small travel mouse and included it in the package.  It's probably okay if you have smaller hands, but not okay for my giant bear paws.
- Doesn't use the unifying receiver technology, so if I wanted to use a different mouse, it would be a different RF receiver (or a wired mouse).  Or, similarly, I can't keep the tiny mouse it comes with in my laptop bag because the receiver is stuck connected to my tower.
- Batteries in the box were DOA (not really a con for me because I keep extra batteries around, but still something to mention).

I bought this kit because it was very cost effective (especially on sale when I bought it) to replace my free-to-me Dell keyboard and 12+ year old MX510 (which is still going strong).  This set does the job quite well.  Time will tell if it shares the same build quality and longevity that I've come to love about Logitech.

Overall, I knocked off a star because of the tiny mouse, but mostly because it doesn't use the Unifying receiver.  But if those two issues are okay for you, then it's a good, budget-conscious keyboard and mouse set.","A great, if basic, keyboard and mouse set.",1463529600,

The console does not support bluetooth, but I didn't want to use a wired USB keyboard and mouse like some kind of savage, this seems like a happy medium.

I am a lighting designer and theatrical electrician by trade, and have long relied on logitech mice like the Performance MX, MX Master, and Anywhere MX versions 1&2 for use with my computer, especially when I do drafting in Vectorworks. Logitech has always worked well for me over the years.

This keyboard work well with my light console (I also tested them with my mac and they work fine as expected for those too).

The Keyboard feels much more well built than I expected. It is solid. It is not as nice to type on as my DAS Model S professional keyboard that I use at my computer, but it also doesn't cost nearly as much. The keys have maybe a little more key travel than I would like for this kind of key switch (A rubber dome), but the keyboard is overall nice for the price, it pleasantly surprised me. Besides, for use with a light console the keyboard won't be used too much.

The mouse isn't as heavy or large as I would like. It is incredibly light weight. I tend to like heavier mice, but it feels like I'm not even holding anything in my hands when I use this mouse. I do have large hands, too, but even people with smaller hands will probably find this mouse small.

The Mouse and Keyboard work together well from one receiver, and ""imitate"" being a wired mouse and keyboard perfectly. My light board is supposed to only support wired mice and keyboards, but this works perfectly. This keyboard and mouse would work great with legacy systems.

I also just have to take a moment to say that not only do both the keyboard and mouse come with batteries, but they are high quality Duracell batteries. Now that's nice touch!","For the price, a great keyboard and a mediocre mouse. Over all, I am happy with my purchase.

I like the MK710, K800, and the K750 better, but this is my favorite of the cheaper wireless ones.

It used to be better because the keyboard was unifying compatible. Then I could put am M325 and the MK270 keyboard on the same usb receiver.

It's not the best wireless keyboard and mouse combo out there, but it's one of the better ones I've seen for its price.

First, let's get the negatives out of the way.  This is from the budget end of Logitech's offerings and that is immediately obvious from the less than stellar build quality of both components.  The keyboard is fine overall and feels better than the cheaper ones you'd find in person from most local big box retailers, but there's no denying the mediocre build quality.  Likewise for the mouse - it performs adequately but feels a bit on the cheap side and only has a couple of buttons and the scrollwheel.  This mouse is often sold alone and I actually had one already.  My only other complaint about the mouse is that it's a tad too small.

Now, I'd still recommend this, especially if you're looking for a keyboard and mouse that won't be used daily.  I use these items a few times a week and they've filled a specific need I had perfectly.  I mostly use it with a Kangaroo mini PC at a range of roughly 12-15 feet.  I've also tested it on my Nvidia Shield Android TV.  If any space between the items and the receiver is blocked, occasionally it may fail to register a key or button press, but those instances have been rare in my experience.  An example of this is if I have it in bed and have a knee up, I occasionally run into that problem.  I've used the keyboard and mouse for light typing, web browsing and playing some games and they've performed acceptably in all of these tasks.

If you're considering a wireless keyboard and mouse that will see light to moderate use, this i a good buy.  For heavier use, you may want to consider something a bit more substantial.",A good budget wireless keyboard and mouse,1462924800,

It took me about 2 days to figure out which one to order and I'm just so glad I decided on this one.

I also wanted one with the right sized letter keys. It's perfectly sized for using on top of my little portable laptop desk and  it's so easy to pair with my laptop. There are little legs on the bottom, if you like to prop it up at an angle.
What I really love about this set is the simplicity, when it comes to setting it up. Just plop 2 AAA batteries into the back of the keyboard, put a AA battery into the mouse and stick the little nano receiver into your laptop's USB port. Next just turn on both the keyboard and the mouse and 'Voila!', you're good to go! At least that was my experience. I'm not a person in a rush any more and I tend to just go with the flow nowadays.

The thing that makes me give it 2 stars...
Getting them to reconnect after you power them off at the switch. This drives me insane, they do not auto connect no reestablish connection if the usb receiver is left in the USB port! I have to unplug the receiver then turn them off and back on then plug the receiver back in after approx 30 seconds of unplugging. For most the world this is unlikely to be an issue if you never turn of the devices. For me its critical, I do industrial programming and to close my lap top and turn of the mouse and keyboard to move to other equipment then to have to fight to get them connect drives me insane and waste my time.

The software is useless to. It will only do something if it finds them, which it does not with this issue. They are also not a unifying device. Also you can not disable or change the power button function. Who's idea was it to place a power button between 2 common use and configurable hot function keys.......

Shin,"I've been a long time Logitech keyboard/mouse user and have several products that get daily use, from the MX mouse to the K800 keyboard.  I got issued a pretty stinky laptop at work with twitchy keyboard so I decided to use an external keyboard and found MK270. It's low-priced enough that I can treat it as a disposable keyboard if I don't like it.

I really like the price and as for the keyboard, it's quite the performer.  It's pretty compact, which I really enjoy and the keystrokes feel fine. Bonus features are the extra buttons for controlling things like volume and instant button for calculator.  Every keyboard should have these.  I like backlit keys but you can't expect it at this price.  I suspected the mouse to be useless for me b/c it didn't appear to have a back button and sure enough, it doesn't have a back button, therefore, unfortunately, it's not of any use to me.  Otherwise, this might have been a really great one-two combo deal.

What kills this set is that I found out after I received the package that this keyboard does not come with a unified receiver.  I've long used Logitech so to me, unified receiver is the norm and a very useful feature as you only have to burn one USB port to connect keyboard and mouse as long as you stay in the Logitech family (which I'm fine with).  Wouldn't you know it, the most popular review points this out!  This is very disappointing, especially to find out that there was a unified receiver version. As mentioned before, I wouldn't use the mouse from the set so I'd use another mouse which is fine, except now I need two USB ports... it's fine if you have a laptop with a plethora of ports.  My ultrabook only comes with two and this means I've taken up both.  Not good.","Lack of unified receiver really hurts; otherwise, great low-priced wireless keyboard",1458950400,

This severely limits how I can use this device.

For example, I already have a Unifying Receiver plugged into the computer (for my wireless Logitech mouse). If this product was compatible, I can simply use the software to add the keyboard without having to take up another USB slot. But I can't do that.

Also, if I ever lose the receiver from this item, I cannot get a replacement.

Other higher-priced Logitech keyboard-mouse combos do usually come with the Unifying Receiver.

Other than that, for the set itself:

(1) The keyboard is quite solid. It doesn't have a wrist rest, and it's lightweight. But it's compact and has everything I need. Buttons for media, volume, calculator, etc.

(2) The mouse is flimsy and cheap. It does the job for basic tasks. But I would generally prefer to use my favorite Logitech mouse instead, which is why having having everything connected with a Unifying Receiver would be a good thing.

If you want this particular keyboard (but no mouse) with a unifying receiver, you could get this product instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-K270-with-Long-Range-Wireless/dp/B004N627KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Wireless Keyboard K270 with Long-Range Wireless</a>

I keep buying them because Amazon has a fairly poor selection of wireless keyboards, and I often find myself without the time to find a better supplier.  I use these keyboards at work, because they are full-size (in the sense of having the keys laid out properly and including a number pad) and wireless, but lack many of the utterly useless bloatware keys that bulk up (both physically and price-wise) virtually all of the other wireless keyboards on offer.  Memo to manufacturers: never in my life have I wished that I could start a media player by pressing a dedicated key.

The positives are that the keyboard is often inexpensive (I bought this combo package this time because it was actually cheaper than the keyboard alone, an accurate reflection of the value added by the included mouse), it takes about ten seconds to set up, the battery lasts a long time (more on that later) and it's the right size.

The negatives are durability and performance.  The longest one of these will last is about nine or ten months, which is less time than the battery life (if you want to look on the bright side of things).  This is also one of the least appealing keyboards I have ever used.  The keys feel and even sound kind of squishy--this is the opposite of a pleasing tactile and auditory experience.  Moreover, the squishiness tends to lead to finger fatigue more quickly than other styles of keyboard (either chiclet or, on the other extreme, mechanical), increasing typos.

The final analysis is thus ""does the low price compensate for the low quality?""  And the answer is no.  I've spent about $60 on these keyboards over the last two and a half years.  My next keyboard will doubtless cost as much as I've already spent, but will certainly last longer on a dollar-for-dollar basis and be better to use to boot.","Cheap, But Still Not Worth It",1456099200,

I have had nothing but problems with this one.  Both the mouse and keyboard LAG.  And not just a little.  I plugged in the receiver, Windows loaded the driver, and after that I couldn't even type my password.  It types a few letters, then stops, then after a few seconds puts all the rest of the keys there at once.  But since it is lagging, you don't know if it is working at all and might hit extra keys, backspace, etc.  REALLY ANNOYING.  Mouse is no better.

I thought it was that computer (which has Windows 7).  I thought it was the distance, so I bought a 3 foot USB extender so the receiver can be closer and away from the computer more.  I replaced the batteries.

So I booted Linux thinking maybe it was the driver.  Didn't fix it.  So I put it on another computer with Windows 10.  Didn't fix it.

Then I read several other reviews saying that they had this problem, with no solution from Logitech.  The only clue I found is that perhaps it is something with the USB3 slot... it may only be compatible with USB2.

I can't imagine that Logitech would let this out the door with their name on it if this were the normal case.  It is really unusable.  So perhaps it is some other issue, but mine's going in the garbage anyway.

EDIT:
I did a little bit more testing about the USB3/2 issue.  I plugged it into an old computer that has only USB2.  Still a problem.  However I was able to get it to work normally by moving the keyboard RIGHT UP NEXT TO THE transmitter, and ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION.  The receiver is a little nano USB thing with a long flat end facing out of the USB port.  If you position the keyboard such that the back of the keyboard faces directly at the long flat end (with ""Logitech"" written on it), it works at close range (within about 1 foot).  The mouse also works in that position.  If you move the keyboard or mouse to the left or right of the transmitter, it no longer works.  So if you have a setup where you can keep the receiver right behind the keyboard, facing the keyboard, it could work for you.

Obviously this is not going to work for a lot of people including me, where the USB ports point to the left or right, not straight at me.",Waste of money,1454198400,

It not only is sluggish on initial typing, it drops characters in the middle.  Bottom line is that the keys are solid with a nice feel, but the delays and interrupted character flow are intolerable.  If you type in one continuous stream it seems to be ok, but pause for a second and it can take several seconds to wake up again.  In the meantime, you may have typed something only to look up later and find out a major something is missing.

UPDATE II:  Got the replacement keyboard, and the switch on this one works.  I upgraded the review to three stars.  The reason is the delay on the keyboard when first starting to type.  It buffers some of the characters, but often misses the first one or two.  It's an OK keyboard for the feel of the keys and the mouse has far less lag than the keyboard.  If you're expecting it to work like a wired keyboard, this isn't good enough.  I still have it and may learn to work around the kinks.  At best, it's a so-so product.  Maybe you get what you pay for here.

UPDATE:  The keyboard finally quit working completely.  Seems like the on/off switch is bad.  Maybe this thing would be OK.  We'll see once it gets replaced.

Bought this because of the generally good reviews.  My experience is not good.  The mouse works fine.  The keyboard works fine ONCE IT MAKES A CONNECTION.  The keyboard goes off line if not in nearly constant use.  Then is is a devil of a time getting it to wake back up.  If you start typing without watching the screen, nothing will appear for several, possibly several tens of characters, then it finally starts.  Very difficult to use if you have an expectation that the keyboard will wake up rapidly, or at least buffer what you've typed and not drop the first characters before responding.  The keys have a nice feel, but the delay on waking the keyboard up makes this a very difficult product to use.  It does NOT use the unified Logitech device system, but I really don't care about that.  (The keyboard is less than 3 feet from the nanoreceiver and on the same side as the receiver.  I've tried multiple USB slots with no improvement).  I generally like Logiecth devices but this one is a big disappointment.  Once it's awake, it works fine, but the delay to wake it up is horrible.  The mouse does NOT share that characteristic so it's a keyboard issue only.",Very slugish Keyboard response.,1451779200,

I have average sized hands and I really did not like the feel of the mouse. It's too light and too small. The wireless range is normal. I get perfect reception even around 4-5 feet through a desk. I also did not like the placement of the calculator button. I prefer the model where the calculator button is above the number pad (I use the calculator often). It's a cheaper keyboard and mouse combo. It'll work fine for general use, but I had a defective one.

Defects:
When I received the unit the mouse kept making clicking noises like there was a loose piece of plastic on the mouse. I found the noise to be the battery cover. I cut a piece of 3M foam tape and stuck it to the inside of the battery lid to silence it. Then 2 weeks into using it, the mouse stopped tracking movement. I could click, but the pointer would not move. I tried other mice and they worked fine (wired and unwired testing to see if it could be my PC). I'm returning this product.

I have large hands (I'm 6'4""), and I worried when I opened the mouse that it would be too small for me. But I have not had any cramps, and it feels fine to use.

The keyboard keys are a little noisier than I wanted. I especially like a quieter keyboard when I'm on a phone conversation, so this is definitely a reason to take a star off.

The other thing that I don't care for is the top row of hot keys. The sound keys are fine, and I used those a lot. But the rest of the keys are not too useful, and the software doesn't allow enough combustibility. For instance, if I hit the power key, it puts the computer into deep sleep. Since it';s a docked laptop, I then have to open the laptop and hit the power key on the laptop itself. What a pain. I wish I could assign the power key to just do a lock.

But I do like that I can turn off caps lock. I do that on all of my Macs, but Windows doesn't have nearly as sleek of a way. With the software included with this keyboard, I can do that. Finally!

Overall, it's good, but next time I will be looking for something quieter.","Solid keyboard, but noisy",1450310400,

The keyboard portion of this package is just fine and does the job, thank you. The mouse however is a different story. It's about double the size of a breath mint and this is supposed to be for a desktop PC situation?

Pros: Keyboard is small, but not mini, just slim and has smooth operation and doesn't feel small for typing and usual use. The USB dongle system of Logitech is about the only real positive decent thing about them.

Cons: The mouse is far too small to be of any real use for normal size or larger hands. I thought it would be normal size and it was hard to tell by the picture. Logitech does not build things to last very long and I expect the keyboard to only last perhaps a year before the lettering on the keys disappears through normal use. I've owned plenty of Logitech keyboards and products including their top of the line wireless keyboard and mouse. The keyboard key lettering only lasted a year even on that. Cheaper boards use laser engraved keys and they last forever.

Overall, if your looking for a temporary wireless keyboard with a slim design and you have smaller than normal hands, this is a an ok choice. Otherwise, I suggest looking at other brands and choices.","Ok for a temporary wireless keyboard, but the mouse is worthless.",1449878400,

The shape of the mouse is small but weighted. Which I like. Makes it easier to click and I don't have to reach way forward like on some mice that strain the hand.

However there is a problem with the mouse movement locking up. It still clicks, but won't move the cursor. Turning it off and on again does nothing. The only fix I've found is to pull the battery for a few seconds then put it back in. And then it seems to reset.
I've had this happen about 3 times since I got it. Twice while gaming online and it was not fun.
Not too big of a deal unless you're a gamer. The response time on this isn't the best anyway. But it does alright.
There doesn't seem to be an auto off either. So if you don't shut it down then the battery will likely drain faster. But I often forget.

I bought it to use with a Raspberry Pi that uses an old laptop monitor.  Because I am limited on space, I can shove the screen/Raspberry Pi in the corner and use the mouse/keyboard from anywhere in the room.  When my media center/arcade/robot/whatever is done, I'll be able to control it wirelessly from wherever I want!  The combined 2-in-1 dongle is perfect due to the limited usb space and its low profile goes perfectly with my Wi-Fi dongle.

The keyboard has pretty soft keys, which makes switching over from my mechanical keyboard feel a bit weird.  The key layout overall is good.  The power switch is in a obvious spot, and is color marked, so it is easier to remember to turn it off when you're not using it.  The keyboard is light, which is great for a portable, wireless keyboard.  If you're interested in specifics, I believe the keyboard has 6 n-key rollover.  This means if you press and hold keys, it will stop reading keys at the 6th key.

The mouse has good tracking and is a good size for a wireless mouse.  I have not had any issues with my hand cramping after using it, and I have fairly large hands.  The buttons are responsive, and the scroll wheel feels good.  The power switch is on the bottom, so hopefully turning off your keyboard will remind you to turn off your mouse.

I have no issues with this mouse/keyboard set.  If you plan to do any gaming or long term computing, get yourself a proper keyboard and mouse.  Wireless peripherals should be avoided when gaming (I'm talking shooters, RTS, MOBAs- not Farmville, Solitare, etc.  Those would be okay).  Obviously, if you're planning to be moving around or a significant distance away from your computer, wireless is the way to go and this is a great option.

Would recommend for a wireless keyboard/mouse option.",A great value wireless option,1449014400,

No problems with interference. Tracking is awesome, and no missed strokes on the keyboard. Feels very comfortable to type. It's a touch on the noisier side but it's in a home office area, so that isn't much of a problem. The mouse is on the smaller side but still pretty comfortably in my hand. However, I have small hands-- so it may be uncomfortable in large hands.

There is an ""On/Off"" switch on both the keyboard and mouse. I often forget to turn them off so I'm hoping it doesn't impact the battery life too much. However, I had bought rechargeable AA and AAA's in anticipation of running through the batteries quickly. Accordingly to Logitech, they should last a long time even if left on.

There's an array of media/sound keys on top of the board that seem supported across XP up to Windows 10-- in my own experience, no issues so far. Just drop the USB receiver in the system and you're good to go. I recommend dropping them in your older USB ports so you don't needlessly use up all of your USB 3.x ports.

Mouse tracks amazingly on my gaming mouse pads. On my desk (without a pad) it slows down the speed but there's no jerkiness or issues in tracking.. just slows down the pointer speed. On a mouse pad it's snappy and precise.","Love it, might buy another couple",1448236800,

The first was a ways back for my work laptop, Windows 7 based computer.  Plugged in the tiny USB hub and both the keyboard and mouse were working in seconds.  I like the larger keyboard for the number pad and the various shortcut keys at the top that all function nicely (volume up and down, mute, email, browser launch, even calculator).  Let's me be comfortable while I type.  Mouse is small but I like that, never one for bulky mice.  And the USB hub fits nicely into the mouse should you need to pack it up.

Purchased the second for my Chromebook and it was up and running even faster than my laptop.  Couldn't believe how nicely it works.  My kids do a lot of internet based homework for school and again the separate number pad makes life easier for them as they work through their math homework.  Mouse is far easier for them than the touch pad on the Chromebook.

Finally, what I did not realize is that the keyboard and mouse both have an effective range of 20-30 feet (perhaps more).  I just had surgery and was confined to bed for a week.  I hooked my laptop up to my LED Flat Screen, and then laid in bed with the keyboard and mouse, a good 10-15 feet away, and was able to do work and keep myself entertained.  Loved that I could leave the laptop sitting elsewhere and never had to get up to do anything with it, just used the keyboard and mouse as I normally would.  And last night we were at my in laws and streaming something on the Chromebook.  Everyone wanted to see it so we hooked it up to their 60"" LED and used the mouse from across the room (a good 20 feet) to switch between videos.  Again, the Chromebook was right next to the TV and sound system, and we handled everything from across the room.  Not a big deal to some, but a really nice side benefit for those of us who periodically like to hook up our laptops to the home entertainment system.

I usually try to turn the keyboard and mouse off but often forget at my work computer.  They either use no battery power or they have an auto-off function because I've replaced the AA battery once in two years.","Great combo, Purchased two",1446681600,

The mouse is small enough to be easily portable, but still fills most of my hand. The keys on the keyboard have a great solid press to them, that makes typing a breeze, and they're not super loud. I haven't had any compatibility issues with it; it works great for both my MacBook Pro and my Windows 10 desktop. Setup couldn't be easier, just plug and play! I leave the pair of them on all the time, and I'm still going strong on battery about two months in, so they're efficient. The shortcut keys at the top (volume, pause/play, homepage, power, etc.) are really useful, and I take advantage of them regularly.

Honestly, I love almost everything about this keyboard and mouse. My only issue is the range capabilities. This won't be a problem for the normal user, but I have a living room PC setup. I do a lot of schoolwork with this keyboard, and sometimes when I press the keys nothing shows up, but then I'll move it a little closer and all of the letters (or some of them) appear at once. I don't have a huge living room; the keyboard is only about 8 feet from the receiver, so it's a little frustrating that I don't have a solid connection. The description advertises a ten meter range, but maybe that's only for uninterrupted space, without any couch corners or propped up feet in the way. Or I could've just received a lemon unit. Either way, I find myself regularly holding the keyboard out in front of me to get the last several words I typed to appear on screen.

Other than the occasional heavy lag at larger distances though, there is very low latency, and I couldn't ask for anything more when using the keyboard & mouse up close to whatever computer I'm using. It's a great value, and I would definitely recommend to a friend.","Awesome keyboard, not great at long ranges",1443312000,

I have been very busy and didn't try it out as soon as I got it and it is now too late to return it. So Im going back to my little HP keyboard until I find an ergonomic I like that actually works.

I've been using them for about a month and haven't had any signal loss.  I use these both on the couch from 12'-15' away from the USB receiver. I use the mouse on all types of surfaces...Couch arm, cushion, end table, shirt (when standing in the middle of the living room changing the song on spotify, lol). The keyboard while being a full qwerty with number pad and function buttons is still slim and easy to keep out of the way on the couch.  The hot keys are also an added bonus. dedicated volume controls, a calculator launch button, a hibernate button and a couple buttons you can set to do/open what you choose. Great product!

**UPDATE** 11-28-2015**  Keyboard and Mouse randomly started cutting in and out about a month after first use (just a few days after writing first review). Just today the mouse's ""Right-button"" stayed ""clicked"" and selected anything the pointer hovered over.

I have found that the keyboard is a little awkward. How? I can't really explain it without simply saying that I make A LOT more typing errors with this keyboard than any other. I think it may have to do with the spacing of the keys, or the size of the keys. There seems to be a much narrower percent error when keystroking that increases the potential to fat-finger keys.

The mouse is OK for a wireless mouse. Overall this is a decent option for a mouse/keyboard combo if you are in the market for one in this price range.

The MK270 product text mentions the ""nano-receiver,"" which I assumed to be new words for their ""Unifying Receiver.""  These USB receivers look the identical, except for the screening on the top surface.  They are not identical!
If I had only this logitech set, it would be a non-issue, but now I have this ""nano-receiver"" set and two ""Unifying Receiver"" mice,
No I have two highly losable recievers that need to be changed out when I change the Logitech HW I'm using.
Logitech is violating their own ""Unifying Reveiver"" concept.

At least the mouse has a recepticle in the battery compartment that can hold the receiver.
I wish the keyboard had such a recepticle somewhere.

I'm also carrying frustation against Amazon for listing this set in my search results for ""mac keyboards.""  Sure, it works with a mac, but sub-optimally.  It's got a ""Windows"" key to the left of the left Alt key, and the windows ""context menu"" key to the right of the right Alt key.  The ""Windows"" key functions as the Mac ' key.
The problem set is:
- As the command key is the most often used modifier in OS X, having this key on only 1 side of the space bar is a great frustration.  Having it 1 key further removed from the space bar makes it even more so.
- The Alt keys are seldom used in OS X, but they lie on ether side of the space bar where the command key normally lies.  These Alt keys invite bad keystrokes that require undoing & restroking.  Your keyboard should accelerate your production, not impare it.
- The logitech unifying software on my mac does not recognize the nano receiver devices, so at this point I haven't figured out if there's any recourse.

I don't know what it is about ""heft"" that makes a product seem more substantial, but neither MK270 device has it.  They're both lightweight & ""feel cheep,"" but that feeling is Totally Unfounded in any Performance indications.  After light use typing up this report, I'm starting to suspect the ergonomics of the keyboard.

Net assessment:
Fine devices <italics>as long as</italics> you don't need compatibility with Logitech's ""Unifying Receiver"".  If you have ""unifying reciever"" devices, then look elsewhere.
I say this keyboard is probably OK for windows.  Until I find some way to remap the 'Alt' keys to the 'command' key function, I discourage using this with any Mac..

Even after reading one of the customer questions that said the mouse was full-size and even someone stating that their husband had large hands and found it comfortable, I was mislead. Not only is the mouse small, but it has no height to it so there's nothing to rest the weight of your palm on. My fingers and hand feel cramped even with casual use, let alone heavy use such as gaming or art. All of this said, I should also note that my hands aren't on the large side... the mouse is just that small.

The keyboard is also on the small side, but the keys aren't cramped or arranged in any weird layout. The keyboard is also very quiet in comparison to the other keyboards I have used, but at a cost: the keys feel almost spongy to the press. But despite this oddity I can't complain much about the keyboard.

The range and responsiveness is something this does excel where other products I have used failed. My layout is with my desktop on the side of my desk to the left near the floor, and my mouse to the right of me. Other mouses I have used tend to have difficulty with this, and I experienced plenty of stuttering, missed clicks and other general ""slightly out of range"" symptoms. I have not experienced any of that with this combo however.

For the price this would have been a perfect set for me, but the mouse has completely ruined it. I'm not sure why they decided to package a ""mobile"" mouse with a keyboard, but if you're looking for a desktop set beware.",NOT a full-size mouse!,1437177600,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qposZbrVL._SY88.jpg']

The left shift and the left option key seemed to think each other are pressed too when one of them was pressed, while the right ones are functioning alright. For a person who regularly uses the left keys more than the right, this is a huge inconvenience. Otherwise, I know I am not the most gentle person with my keyboards -- I abuse them heavily as if I am playing a piano, typing violently and very fast. To avoid further damage to my macbook keyboard, I have to look for an external keyboard that will withstand my abuse. I read through the reviews here, at first worried that it won't function with my mac, but decided to go with this as nobody reports any bothersome problem. The wireless combination is another big plus as I hate wires.
So it came. It is very light and thin, much lighter than what I am used to, but it is a full-size keyboard without being too big. I plugged it in, and my mac prompted me to configure the type of keyboard it was connected to (Dvorak, standard, or what's not), and immediately recognized it as a standard English keyboard after this easy process. The windows key became the command key, alt key = option key automatically. Print screen, scroll lock, and pause/break became F13-15 (which is useless for me). Alt=option key still functions very nicely for umlauts. The downside is that there is no fn key, but since there are insert, page up and down keys, fn key is not needed. Another downside is that I need to relearn keyboard geography (switch of position between command and option keys), but I quickly adapt to this. If you are a mac user who considers buying this keyboard, and wanted to remap certain keys, you can download Karabiner -- something I did. Only four out of the eight hot keys function on the iOS (play/pause, volume controls). Volume control is a huge plus, but the other keys not functioning don't bother me. Yes, there is a light that indicates caps lock is on or off, but no light for num lock or scroll lock, for me they don't matter because this is a keyboard for macbook air, not iMac or other PCs, and these two keys don't function anyway. If you want to type in other languages or keyboard system, you can still configure within the mac (software, not hardware) and understand what keys have changed after switching keyboard system.
Now the slightly problematic part. This keyboard has two stands to elevate it for easier typing, but that two stands seem very flimsy and thin and I worry they will break easily. This keyboard is also not quiet - I tried typing with less force, the clicking sound is still too much; so at full speed violent typing this thing is going to create a symphony. The keys are also not as flat as I would like (macbook keyboards are very flat), but at this price and for an external keyboard, I am not going to complain.
Now the mouse. From amazon's website, I am assuming I will get a small travel mouse, but imagine my surprise when I received the M185 mouse! I already had one for my windows laptop and I love that thing, have been abusing it for 4 years and it is still going strong. It is not too small, which allows comfortable usage, and not too big to deter from it being tossed into the luggage for travel. This is fantastic.
Oh, I don't think I received a nano unifying receiver. So my dongle is simply for the keyboard and this new mouse, without affecting my old mouse. Some people might have a problem with this, but I can't care less with this arrangement. Now I will get back to abuse my new keyboard. For such a violent typist as me, I of course hope this will last. If it don't, I will update.",Superb keyboard for abuse as for now - by a violent typist.,1436745600,

The mouse works fine for the most part. But the keyboard is a total failure.
This keyboard is kept 10' away from my home theatre PC and it is always a pain to use. Every 20 minutes or so, it will just lose its connection for about a full minute. Even when it does work, it has a lot of lag between when I press a key and when the keystroke appears on screen. I hate this keyboard so much.
I should've returned it weeks ago but kept thinking ""maybe I'm doing something wrong"". I made sure the computer still worked with other keyboards (it did). I made sure there were no objects obstructing the line-of-sight from the keyboard to the adapter. Nothing seems to change the fact that this thing struggles to connect when it's more than 3' away from the adapter. Do not purchase.",Short range and unreliable. Avoid.,1436227200,

I love Amazon... they replaced it FAST and at no cost to me.  However, I've discovered a problem with the ""technology"" somehow.  With my old wireless keyboard, I NEVER had a problem with my typing being interrupted... now I'll be typing and I'll look up to discover that nothing is printing on the screen.  Then it will try to catch up, but only get maybe every other letter, so I have to go back and fill in the text.  I have always used Logitech (since the 80's) and loved their keyboards.  My previous wireless keyboard was wonderful... but I had a liquid spill and lost some keys, so I had to replace it.  I immediately went for the combo mouse/keyboard (I thought I was getting the same thing I had!).  One keyboard has already been replaced with a wired keyboard, I'm thinking about replacing the second one with a wired keyboard and perhaps the third.  This is NOT good.  Logitech seems to think it's the frequency they are now using for the wireless operation... and with interference from wireless phones, wireless routers and even cell phones!  I'm not sure if it's that or something else, but the problem becomes VERY irritating.  I actually believe the problem is in the driver - and the keyboard priority.  The keyboard should always have priority.  I have made my keyboard work better by keeping some programs from starting (removing from the startup file), and that seems to have helped quite a bit.  So, I don't think it's a frequency problem... but buyer beware... if you don't want the frustration of hesitation and lost text, don't use this mouse/keyboard combo.  In fact, if you read the Logitech forum, you will discover that Logitech is having problems with all of their wireless combo sets right now.  I hate to knock Logitech but they need to fix the problem.  Too bad I already disposed of my old wireless keyboard/mouse.

But you need to command the computer, and you can't do so by thinking at your monitor. So you buy a mouse and keyboard. But you're short on cash and don't want to deal with wires that you might step on or run over with your chair.

So you buy this keyboard and mouse. At $20, it's very affordable. The keyboard is powered by two AAA batteries. The mouse is powered by a single AA battery. There is a minor gripe to be made here, and that is, ""why do I need two different kinds of batteries for two things in the same box? The keyboard isn't any smaller for using smaller batteries, there's no point."" Oh well. That just means you have to buy two different kinds of batteries (a one-time purchase if you buy rechargeable ones.)

They each have their own ON/OFF power switch, and they communicate to the computer through a USB dongle that only sticks a little more than one-quarter of an inch from the port (or a little less than one centimeter.) If you desire, you can choose to turn off either of the devices without impeding the other's performance. If you have another mouse you prefer, you can use that in conjunction with this keyboard. Or you can use the mouse in conjunction with a laptop's built in keyboard. And if you own a desktop and are paranoid about hitting the dongle and breaking your USB port, you can put a USB port inside of your computer's case with a little adapter that plugs into a USB header on your motherboard.

The keyboard itself is about what you would expect at this price point. It has all the keys you need, as well as a number pad and some media keys (pause/play, volume, etc.) The little ""A"" next to the power switch also lights up when Caps Lock is turned on. It would be nice if it also had an indicator light for Num Lock. The keys aren't too loud, and are pretty responsive, though it's not always clear when you've pressed the key down enough for the board to register the input. The keys have a fair amount of travel, and a fair amount of wiggle. If you want a keyboard that's a little bit more consistent at recognizing your keystrokes, you should save up a bit more.

The mouse is even more basic than the keyboard. That isn't a negative point, because it isn't meant to do more than it needs to do. You have your standard left button, right button, and clickable scroll wheel. The wheel scrolls up or down, and doesn't feel as good as other mice within its price range. If you need a wheel that also tilts for lateral scrolling, you'll have to look at another mouse. The mouse is an optical type, but doesn't have an annoying glow when you lift it off your desk. Within the battery compartment, there's a little slot you can store the USB dongle in for storage. Nifty. The mouse doesn't drop inputs the way the keyboard does, so I will probably be using it more than I use the keyboard.

Overall, it's pretty good for $20. Since the set is made by Logitech, it will probably last a long time. It's also extremely easy to use. Literally plug and play.",Free yourself from the shackles of wired input devices,1434844800,

If you're a techie like me you probably have several laying around. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of the more expensive Logitech models, but the keyboard is comfortable to use, the mouse fits great in your hand really what more could you ask for?

Well well if you're like me you probably do ask for more anyway and Logitech certainly delivers. One of the problems with USB Mice and Keyboards can be that they take up too many available USB ports, and Logitech takes care of this by ensuring that you are taking up as small of a footprint as possible with a single USB dongle which is just large enough to plug in to a single USB port and give you just enough room comfortable grip it to pull it our or insert it firmly into the port. If you're using it for an on the go application like with your laptop, the USB dongle is small enough to leave in your laptop or you can store it in a special slot that Logitech included next to the battery for storage. To save battery life you can also turn both the Mouse and Keyboard off when they are not in use.

Unfortunately, this keyboard no longer support the Unifying Receiver and uses a ""nano receiver"" instead. I don't understand why Logitech is moving away from the Unifying Receiver for this budget model keyboard mouse combo. Perhaps to save cost. I didn't use the mouse as a have another mouse already (Logitech Anywhere Mouse MX)

The keyboard has the multimedia keys that I was looking for including Play/Pause, Mute, Volume Up/Down and sleep. I wish there was a multimedia skip button, but that's not a big issue. The keyboard is not those special chiclet style, but gets the job done. It takes some time getting used to the keyboard, but should do just fine once I'm used to it. The keyboard isn't very quiet so I wouldn't suggest using it in a room with someone sleeping.

Software: The included Setpoint software has a lot of great features such as OSD (on-screen display) for caps lock, volume, and changing special function keys. However, installing the software changes the default ""OS implementation"" of the settings which I am used to. Also, the software is 40-50MB which is way too huge of a program. It should be streamlined down with the option to download additional keyboard/mice as needed. The software makes my keyboard/mouse feel laggy.

The single USB is handy and connected without any issue very quickly allowing me to immediately begin using the devices. I was pleased to find that, even with the Windows XP OS on the PC I am using this with, the included hotkeys at the top of the keyboard (home, mail, *power* PC, calculator) all work flawlessly and require no setup. The mouse is quite small but, as I anticipated the size, I am not disappointed with it. I can't use my whole hand on top of it like the mouse it replaced, but instead just the front of my palm and my fingers, the back of my palm rests on the desk. This, however is not a real issue. My only true complaint is this (and it has nothing to do with the functionality of the devices), the keyboard is extremely quiet and fluid, but the mouse keys (buttons and scroll-wheel when clicked) are quite loud.

My boss is leaving for vacation in two days with a Lenovo tablet. This very expensive tablet has no usb port. (Not Logitech's fault!)

I spent nearly 45 minutes hunting down a way to connect this tablet but it's a no go. It would have been fairly simple for Logitech to make this keyboard speak directly to Bluetooth already on a device vs requiring either a program to be installed or a usb port to be used. In short, this very nice keyboard and mouse combo are useless for his needs. He didn't read the specs before purchasing it and I never thought to double check before he hit the purchase button. (My fault, not Logitech's)

No problem, I decided to review the keyboard and mouse combo on my Win 7 machine that has usb ports. Bam.. It connected as expected. The keyboard is nicer than the one I am using. There is one exception, there are no lights to indicate that the keyboard is turned on. I do not see a light indicating the Num lock or caps lock keys are in use. Minor flaws, but important.

The mouse is a small one, feeling tiny in my female hands. My hand has been known to cramp up when I use small mice due to a bad break x 2 times back in the 80's. This mouse would be fine for anything that is short duration but will be inadequate for gaming. This might be an issue if you are looking for a mouse that will fit a gentleman's hand.

As a sidenote, I had purchased the Logitech K400 model before finding this MK270 combo.

Pros:
-Dirt cheap
-Keyboard and mouse both feel pretty good considering it feels as if they cut costs for cheaper materials

Cons:
-I've experienced instances where both the keyboard and mouse just stop inputting anything even while connected. This becomes a problem when I play video games. I'm not much of an avid gamer, but these instances really pull me away from the action.
-Mouse seems to slow down and catch up. I thought this was my brand new computer, but found it to be the mouse.
-Not very responsive. Some times keys are input a few seconds AFTER pressed.

EDIT: I realized alot of these problems were due to the fact that my wireless router is on the same desk as my unit. With the router between the dongle (located behind the PC) and my desk in front, there is some strange interference issues. Just let that be in mind.

Cons:
-- This combo might not be ideal for people with bigger hands who prefer a bigger mouse.  This mouse is small and tends to cramp my hand when trying to use it.

The one problem with this keyboard/mouse, and it's a genuine one, is that I can't believe they don't have SOME kind of storage for that itty bitty USB receiver. It is just a matter of time before the house gnome swipes it never to be seen again. Every other wireless mouse (I have a collection of them at this point until I've found one I love) have a little storage place on-board to put that receiver. They couldn't have added a little port in either the mouse or anywhere on that entire keyboard in which to store it? Come on.

I've never had this issue with Logitech wireless mice, so not sure if mine is just a dud. I still love this combo though, the issue isn't serious enough to warrant a return.

Update at 8 months: The mouse's scroll-wheel continued to randomly stop working, and then the mouse started failing entirely. I replaced the batteries so that's not the issue.. it just stopped working. Turning it off and on again fixed the issue a couple of times, but now it doesn't work at all.

It's a very low quality mouse, which you almost have to expect for this price point, but it isn't even full size.

I'd strongly suggest buying the keyboard and mouse separately so you can get an actual mouse rather than this pseudo travel mouse.

If you go through keyboards quickly like I do, then this economical board is a good bet.

This keyboard has the buttons in the right location with the right spacing for us who type without looking.  My last keyboard was Microsoft which I picked up at Best Buy because they didn't have this Logitech..  It's keys were all crammed together and made typing impossible without looking down.  The numbers on the keyboard also rubbed off!  Stay away from cheap Microsoft keyboards!

This keyboard has no lights to indicate if cap lock or num lock is on.

The mouse Logitech sent with this is 1/2"" shorter than my last Logitech.  It would fit in a small child's hand and is too small to be comfortable for any adult.

Another new difference with this mouse is that the diode on the bottom does not emit he red light - I don't know how it works!

The Duracell alkaline AA battery that came with the mouse only lasted a week indicating it was almost dead.

They have really been shrinking the size of the transmitter that plugs into your USB.  Several years ago the things were a couple inches long.  Then the next keyboard I bought, it was only 3/4"".

I bought this for a cheap replacement wireless keyboard for my Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 which had been acting up. I was concerned that, being so inexpensive, the keyboard would be unpleasant to type on, but I was wrong! Inexpensive wireless keyboards have come a long way, and this one is simply perfect for me!

*Function Keys*
I use Linux, and as a result I use the function keys a lot (switching terminals and the like). One problem I have with a lot of other keyboards is they like to switch up the function keys with ""media keys"" or ""quick access keys"" or some other ridiculousness which then requires you to press some ""fn"" key any time you actually want to press F12. Not so with this keyboard - the function keys are a nice size, and they are solely dedicated to being function keys.

*Dedicated On/Off Switch*
This is something I didn't think I would like nearly as much as I do - a dedicated on/off switch right on the front allows me to turn the keyboard off and save the battery. All the switches are simple, manual click switches that look like they won't break with normal use.

*Caps Lock Light*
Often, when typing passwords or commands, I will accidentally graze the caps lock key and then I don't know if it is on or off. This usually means I have to erase the password and start over, or just hit return and retype the password. No longer! There is a dedicated light that turns on when Caps Lock is on. This is not the case with Num Lock, unfortunately, but Caps Lock is really the troublemaker in this regard so it is quite nice to have something that used to be a completely standard feature make a comeback.

*The Mouse*
I took off one star for the mouse because it is simply too small for a desktop mouse. It would make a great mouse for a laptop, as it is nice and portable, and it includes a spot under the battery cover to place the wireless receiver, however I think that a wireless keyboard/mouse which is so clearly designed to be used primarily with a stationary computer (you're not lugging the keyboard around with you, are you?) should include a full size mouse.

I forgot to add, that you don't need to install any software!
One major problem.
-the keyboard is unresponsive
EDIT/
I believe the keyboard to be flawed, I try to type, and keyboard does not respond. I try turning it off and turning it back on and it starts work. I just replaced the batteries, and turned it on and the keyboard took about ten to fifteen seconds to respond. I at first i attributed this occurrence to the batteries dying, but once I replaced the batteries the problem persisted; I sit close to the computer so I don't think this is a connectivity issue. For this issue I dropped this from four stars to three. I believe this problem, the keyboard being unresponsive, is worthy of a deduction of stars.

I got it on a deal at Staples in my local area. I wasn't expecting such a finished product for the price and was quite impressed for the $15 I paid. It seems better than the older combo I had in finish and ease of connection. My old system had a large dongle that sat on my desk and would lose range if it fell to the floor. This has a very small unit that plugs in the back of my computer.

The KB is just fine for my needs, I have others that have unnecessary keys that I never use and this just has a few extra fairly useful ones. The KB uses 2x AAA.

The mouse is marketed as a small mouse and it is that but still very functional. So if you like to have a larger mouse then this may not be the right combo for you. The mouse is optical and only uses one AA battery.

I also was very impressed when I attached the Logitech nano receiver and the whole system connected without me messing around with drivers etc, worked very well.

I have used wireless mice (mouses?) for years, but never a wireless keyboard.  Not having wires run all over the place really opens up my workspace.  That both items share a single USB connection is a plus.

The keyboard is very comfortable and responsive.  It's as good as any desktop keyboard I have had.  The mouse is on the smaller side, but it's very comfortable for me.  It is also very responsive.  The mouse is basic, but it does have an auto-scroll feature.  The left and right click have just the right tension, and the scroll wheel works well.

I have only two cautions.  My keyboard would cut out occasionally.  I had used a USB port on the back of my computer and perhaps some other wires or connection was interfering with the signal.  I moved the miniature USB plugin to another port and have not experienced the problem since.

I've used it in my office for the last 5 months every day and it has performed with flawless execution.  It's a superb buy for the money.  Logitech:  You are to be commended for this well-executed product.  Both items are light weight, functional, and the online driver software is easily downloaded, installed and maintained on Windows 7 - effortlessly.  The on-off switches are real battery savers, but neither is battery hungry.  I've only replaced the batteries in the mouse once in 5 months with daily use (40+ hour work week).

I'm a software engineer so these devices take the abuse of heavy use.  I've never been concerned with any range issues as I'm nearby; if the mouse were to die, the unifying software would allow me to buy another Logitech of any model (e.g. M705 Anywhere Mouse) and re-establish the existing connection with the supplied USB wireless short-range Bluetooth adapter.  Another wonderful feature - and I would still have a 'combo' kit.  I am pleased with the tactile feedback of the keyboard, but then I'm spoiled with IBM 3270 keyboards that set the industry standard for excellence for decades.

You can easily check both items in your luggage as I have done, too!

This is a pretty good/cheap Keyboard/Mouse combo. Although I do not use the mouse and use my Logitech G700s instead the vast majority of the time, the mouse works as it should as a bare bones laser mouse.

Good
G1. Wireless and can use the Logitech universal adapter(can connect to newer logitech peripherals aside from gaming devices)
G2. Nice feedback on the keys(NOT mechanical)
G3. Full Standard Keyboard Layout.
G4. Great battery life. Have been using it for over a month on the batteries it came with(2x AAA Energizer alkalines)
G5. Has single height legs to give you keyboard an incline
G6. Hoykeys for quick actions.

Bad

B1. NOT backlit. Not its fault for the price but still.
B2. Extra added keys can not be disabled and has functions that may be annoying if hit accidentally(just in my usage of needing to move around with this keyboard a lot and not necessarily a problem for static desk usage)
B3. Function of the extra keys can not be changed. They possibly can with logitech/3rd party software OS side but I have not done so yet.
B4. Only has a hardware status light for caps lock, and NOT for Scroll lock and NUM lock. They try to compensate with software notifications on screen but leaving you having to check its status by pressing it if you are not sure.

I am dealing with certain issues as follows:

B1. I am using something similar to this:""http://www.amazon.com/Verbatim-Power-Bank-Charger-97928/dp/B007MLHS2S/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1415661581&sr=8-3&keywords=AA+Battery+Pack+USB""

along with some rechargeable batteries to be able to have a light when I need it while not hindering the wireless functionality of the keyboard.
B2. I usually just turn off the keyboard when I am moving with it and turn it back on when I need to use it again. I also changed my settings in windows(advanced power options menu) so the ""sleep key"", which is the most annoying, does not do anything. The rest of them aren't really a problem to me even when pressed accidentally .",I do not regret my purchase even though there are a few caveats.,1415577600,

Another 'secret' I discovered is that the battery compartment on the mouse also has a holder for the USB receiver. This is great for travel, or people like me who have multiple computers and key/mouse combos and don't want to get them mixed up.

You can also download Logitech's software and customize the hot keys on the top of the keyboard (home, mail, PC and calculator). The only drawback is that you must let their software run at Windows startup and use a small amount of memory in the background. Although I couldn't get the 'PC' button to customize.

They keyboard is very minimalistic and doesn't take up much room (as there's no wristpad). The key travel is pretty good, and strokes are firm and responsive (the keys, I might add, are full sized). There is an indicator light for the Caps Lock key, which is great, but no lights for Num Lock or Scroll Lock - which has actually been a  slight inconvenience as I often hit the Num Lock key by accident and then can't type in numbers for a while before realizing that I hit the key. There's a full row of special function keys at the top including email, volume, mute, home, power, calculator - the only ones that I use consistently are the volume/mute ones.

The mouse is small and very responsive - smooth scroll wheel.

Mouse uses 1 AA battery while the keyboard uses 2 AA batteries. No comment on the battery life yet, as I've only had the product for 1 month (I've been switching off the keyboard/mouse whenever I'm not at my desk to extend battery life - both products have easy to access power switches).

All in all, a perfectly functional and very good value keyboard mouse for anyone who has a laptop and wants a full-size keyboard or even for those with a PC tower and monitor - great product for when desktop space is minimal.","Fully Functional, Great Value, Small Profile Keyboard & Mouse Combo",1414454400,

So I decided to get some wireless ones. These ones are the BEST for me. The packaging was very neat and they were not hard to open at all.

I am using the keyboard as I am typing this review and I really love the feel of it. It doesnt take much force or power to press the keys and they are incredibly light! This is a Keyboard and Mouse combo so it just comes with one USB plug for your computer. I have USB 2.0 and they work fine. they work the same if you would plug them onto a USB 3.0 port so either way, you get a great performance from this product. Im using this on a laptop by the way.

Built wise, it seems very durable since I've dropped them literally more than 10 times because my son would grab them from my reach and he would bang and bash on it. But! Hey, they work like new which is a big plus for me! The mouse is the same too, very durable but unless you're throwing them around on purpose, then I don't know how they will hold up. But other than that I give the durability a SOLID 5 STARS!

The feel of the product is very nice. To me they kind feel soft. Like soft keys but not soft. Its really hard to explain but when you buy these for yourselves and use it, then you'll know what I mean.

The functions such as the volume works great like when I'm watching a movie on my laptop hooked up to the TV, I don't want to have to go up to the TV or my Laptop to lower the volume. You can just lower the volume from the keyboard itself. Or increase the volume. the Home button works great on my Windows 8 and I had no problem at all.

I really really love this keyboard! I also use it while gaming and they gave me no problems at all. No random key presses and you get used to the keys and feel quite fast. :)

I highly recommend this to anyone having second thoughts on whether to get this product or not. Don't think anymore! Go for it and buy it! You will not be disappointed! The battery life is incredible so there's no need to conserve your battery. Buy it :)",THERE'S NO NEED FOR SECOND THOUGHTS! BUT IT!,1414281600,

Honestly, it is the best keyboard and mouse I have ever owned.  It has never failed to capture any of my movements; take this with a grain of salt, as my transmitter is less than 3 feet away from them.  I game a lot and have never felt like I was at a disadvantage.  It is nice to not have cables in the way.

On Windows 7, these just plugged in and started working. I didn't even need to hit the sync button. Both are a little small, which works great for my application.  If you are used to larger keyboards, then you might want to look into a different wireless set.

Both mouse and keyboard have a small switch to disable them when not in use.  However, I never turn mine off.  The batteries that came with mine lasted about 10 months.  I didn't actually need to change them, but I was starting to get paranoid...I still can't believe how efficient these are.  You'll get your moneys worth out of your batteries.

The best part is the ridiculously low price.  Honestly, if my set breaks in the next month, I wouldn't feel bad buying another.  I definitely feel like I get my money's worth from these.",One of the best mouse and keyboard sets I've ever owned.,1412899200,

I have had it for years now, and it seems to have gotten better about using up batteries over time.  Weird.  Other than that, I am still disappointed that the signal is so weak: I have to keep it plugged in to the closest USB port, or it just won't work.  But it works!

Original Review: I had wanted a new mouse for some time.  I decided that it might also be nice to have a wireless keyboard.  I perused all the wireless mice, and this one was as highly rated as any other.  After buying it, I have no idea why people have rated it so high.

The main selling point for me was the ""one-year battery life.""  I don't know why I fell for this.  The mouse uses one battery instead of two, so (of course) it can only last half as long.  This reminds me of the days when rechargeable batteries first came out and everyone was making the same nebulous claims.  I mean, I guess it could last a year, if you are a senior citizen who only uses the mouse to check your email once a day.  Otherwise, be prepared to change the battery FREQUENTLY.

What we really need is an objective criteria, like we now have with rechargeables.  Something like: ""X mA per hour of use; X hours expected use with a 2500 mAh battery.""  Another weird thing is that the movement and clicking circuits appear to use different power levels.  So, your pointer will stop moving, but when you pick the thing up to replace the battery--again, you will accidentally click it and mess up your work.

And finally, these things are cheap.  They look and feel like something from the dollar store.  They are tiny, made from a single piece of thin plastic, and they weigh practically nothing.  For about the same price, I could have gone with something more functional, ergonomic, you get the idea.

I recommend that you pass this up and instead select one of the many highly-rated mice for about the same price.","Cheap, Eats Batteries",1412553600,

Now the hockey-puck has been replaced with a tiny piece of plastic no larger than the USB connector itself! My expectation wasn't much, especially since those older products costs several times more.

I'm using it with a GoDock station for my Galaxy S4, turning my smartphone into a pseudo desktop computer!  When I connected the tiny USB receiver into the GoDock, it worked instantly-no pairing buttons, no line-of-site, no dropped connection, I love this product!

The keyboard/mouse distance is about 10 feet from their receiver.

 I was pleased to see that this product also works with my older Mac Mini (OS 10.6.8). Previously the only wireless option had been the expensive bluetooth apple products costing well over $100 for both.

Can't say the same about the mouse, though. The problem is the scroll wheel has a slightly 'scratchy' feel to it. Oh, it turns and generally works okay and I might not have noticed it except for how nice and smooth my other M185 Logitech mouse wheel is. While serviceable, it's annoying. It's a shame because it's an otherwise good, low-price wireless set, superior to offerings by other major companies.

In fact, when compared with the base offerings from HP and Microsoft (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-Wireless-Classic-Desktop-LV290AA-ABA/dp/B00501T8XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP Wireless Classic Desktop (LV290AA#ABA)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Wireless-Desktop-800/dp/B003SVSJ1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Wireless Desktop 800</a>&nbsp;), this is the best of the three. The HP, in particular, gets some really bad reviews. And while the Microsoft keyboard has a low battery indicator, neither of them have an on/off switch (at least that I could see). If they do, they're on the underside, which is nearly as bad as not having one at all. It appears that every Logitech wireless keyboard, regardless of price, has an on/off switch on the front.

Likewise, the Logitech includes a caps lock light (but nothing for number lock). I've read that this is missing on the other, low-line wireless keyboards, too, although there seems to be some kind of downloadable work-around for the Microsoft to get operational caps lock and number lock lights.

There's also the issue of a ridge around the base. The other keyboards (as well as the better Logitechs) have some sort of stabilizing ridge around the periphery. While I suppose this might be okay in nothing but desktop applications, if you happen to decide to use it elsewhere (like on your lap, which is conceivable since it's wireless), that ridge is a PIA. In that respect, this lowest level Logitech is actually better than the more expensive models since it has a rounded edge around the base.

One thing that seems to be missing from all of the most basic wireless keyboard/mouse combos is a unifying receiver. I realize these are bargain-basement specials, but it sure would be nice to be able to switch out a wireless mouse for another and still use the same, solitary, nano receiver (especially when the mouse goes bad).

Finally, although the mouse is cheap, I seriously doubt whether the mice on the other two are any better.

All told, while it may be lacking a few things the other cheap keyboards might have (like certain internet keys), it more than makes up for it with other, better features (as well as good tactile performance). I've even read that the other keyboards lack a calculator shortcut key. Well, the Logitech's got one. For the money, it's your best choice of the cheapie keyboards, even beating out more expensive ones (including Logitech models) in certain respects.",Best of the Cheapie Combos,1411862400,

He was excited to have a faster desktop PC for games and YouTube, and I definitely wanted him to have a wireless keyboard/mouse combo, as he would be typically sitting in his bed, about 8 ft back from his tv/monitor.  The reception is excellent; for the short time he was using wifi (now ethernet) there was no radio interference, and absolutely no connection dropouts for either device.  The combo comes with the standard micro USB wireless dongle, and in my experience, they're pretty good for line of sight coverage up to around 15 feet.  If you have any physical obstructions, you may need to get a USB extension to raise the height of the dongle above the PC.  The keyboard is very thin and lightweight, and the mouse is made for a small to normal sized hand, which make them a perfect fit for my little boy.  Battery life tends to be excellent with wireless combos; with my own set I have not changed the mouse battery in over a year, and the keyboard has only needed batteries replaced once in that time, and I rarely turn mine off.

I finally get it and try and add it to my Unifying receiver, which both my current K270 and Performance MX mouse both use, only to be told the keyboard does not support the unifying receiver. That's a no-go in my setup.

Long story short, they have two almost identical keyboards, that have the same model number that support two different wireless connection methods that are NOT interchangeable. That's great marketing on Logitech's part.

While I bought a wireless gaming mouse to replace the one included, it works well too. Range is pretty solid, I connected the receiver to the front ports in the tower and can use the keyboard from just about anywhere in the living room.

I love the fact that the keyboard is about as compact as possible while still being a full size keyboard. Many wireless keyboards out there have a bunch of extra bells and whistles that adds bulk to the keyboard in the form of extra buttons all around, and I was looking for low profile.

The one big caveat I have here is the power button on this thing! It's way too easy to press this button and inadvertently shut down the computer. I was able to tweak Windows power settings to disable this functionality but it's a roundabout fix to an annoying problem. I feel like this keyboard would be better without it, or at least have software available to easily disable it, and for that I'm knocking off one star.","Range is pretty solid, I connected the receiver to the front ...",1408665600,

I have recently purchased and begun using this wireless keyboard/mouse computer accessory.  I found it reasonably priced, easy to install  even for me, without that much computer knowledge.  And so far it has been reliable: its makers state that it has a robust 2.4 GHz long-range10 meter range -- wireless connection, and a tiny Logitech nano-receiver that connects both the keyboard and mouse using just one USB port, and that is so small it can remain installed in a laptop.  This makes for an all-in-one setup. They also promise long battery life: that the user should be able to get up to 24 months of keyboard power from the 2 AAA batteries provided, and 12 months of mouse power from the single AA battery provided, without having to change them. The keyboard and mouse are equipped with auto-sleep and on/off switches to conserve batteries.  Its sleek full-size keyboard has quiet, low-profile keys, with eight hot keys, so the user can quickly access  movies, music, the Internet, e-mail, volume, play/pause and more.  Its 128-bit AES keyboard encryption will keep your information secure, if you need that. The  long-range enabled mouse, so portable you can pack it with your laptop and take it wherever,  with receiver storage, and quick scroll wheel, is ergonomically contoured for comfortable use.  Further, the makers promise plug and play simplicity for Windows PCs: this item works right out of the box with Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and 8. No software installation required.  The item comes with a three-year limited hardware warranty.

I strongly prefer wireless keyboard/mouse combinations as my work space is cramped: this is the second or third wireless set Ive bought, and  I find it every bit as good as its predecessors, especially considering its reasonable price.  However, I do wish it had come with an instruction booklet: if something isn't working right, you cant always go on line to check it out.  Because I have had one problem with it.  There is a little A on the  cap lock key, and when it is on, a little A lights up on a switch elsewhere on the board.  One night as I was logging off after using the caps lock, I thought Id better turn off the on/off switch by the little A so that I did not, at my next use, find myself in all caps.  So I turned off that switch.  Next day, couldn't start the machine for love nor money, and the problem was in the keyboard/mouse.  Didnt think the batteries could have run out so soon, but I tried changing them, several times.  Nothing worked.  Then I remembered that little A switch, and turned it back on.  Problem solved.  But I needed an instruction booklet.  Now, you could easily be a more knowledgeable, experienced user than I am, and know what that little A is all about, lucky you.  To the rest of us, beware that little A if you buy this item.",As Good as Far More Expensive Competitors,1408233600,

Not sure how that works if the mouse or keyboard ever fails and you need a replacement.  On the software side, you can (and probably should) download the Logitech SetPoint utility from Logitech's website.

So they occupy only one USB port on your computer. The keyboard is powered by two AAA batteries and the mouse is powered by one AA battery.

SURPRISE: I was surprised to discover this: I unplugged the Logitech Unifying Receiver from a live Windows machine and put in the USB port of a Samsung Chromebook. Just like that, both the keyboard and the mouse worked on the Chromebook! No software, no drivers, nothing, they just worked. I only tried this on this Chromebook&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-Chromebook-Wi-Fi-11-6-Inch-2012-Model/dp/B009LL9VDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model</a>

The keyboard weighs around 1 lb 2.4 oz and the mouse 2.6 oz. The weight is with the included alkaline batteries installed and the Unifying receiver not in the mouse. Single-use alkalines from Green Power (GP) were included in the box. I have been using these since I bought it. Once the alkalines run out and head to recycling, I will switch to rechargeables. Despite its small size, the mouse has a spot under the cover on the underside to store the tiny Unifying Receiver. Changing batteries is easy on both the keyboard and the mouse. Both the Keyboard and the Mouse can only be used wirelessly. There is no wired option. Both the Keyboard and the Mouse have the same Off/On slider power button with distinct OFF and ON positions so a usability plus right here. About half the time I forget to turn them off (using with a desktop computer) but the batteries are still fine.

One of the things I like about this keyboard is its compact rectangular size, it is under 17 by 6 inches, and with the two feet extended, it is around 1.5 inch at its tallest. The arrow keys are arranged neatly at right angles and they have their own section. The Keypad is as expected. As with most keyboards these days, the Insert/Delete come before the Home/End in the second cluster of keys (A to Z being the first cluster, and the numeric keypad being the third cluster). There is a row of eight multimedia buttons up top to the left, but they are unassuming and  you can ignore them if you don't care - you won't hit them accidentally - they are out of the way.

A couple of potential deal killers for the keyboard: there is no NUM LOCK light! When you press it, the status is shown on the computer screen but no light. The CAPS LOCK has a light, it shows an uppercase ""A"" next to the power button. The other potential deal killer is that the main Enter button is fairly small, about the size of 2.5 standard keys in length. Depending what keyboards you are used to, it may take some getting used to, but below it is the Shift key, so if you accidentally press Shift, no damage done.

The mouse is basic with two buttons and a scroll wheel. There is no light and no power indicator on the mouse. The power button is on the underside of the mouse and it is the same type as the keyboard.

Neither the keyboard or the mouse are going to win design or performance awards but if you are looking for an unassuming compact combo that gets out of your way and just works, this is a great candidate.",Great Compact Basic non-Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard Mouse Combo (works with Chromebook too),1407542400,

So I bought this combo for when I need to write essays or do more than just casual typing for school. The mouse and keyboard both instantly synced up to my tablet. I used a StarTech.com otg to usb adapter plug to connect the usb drive to my tablet and everything works flawlessly. I am writing this review right now with the keyboard on my tablet.

My main complaint is that you have to connect it to your computer using a very small usb drive that must stay connected to your computer in order to get the signal from the mouse/keyboard and there is only one of them for both the keyboard and the mouse.  I wish that I could connect the two using bluetooth or something like that so I could use the keyboard with one computer and the mouse with another but then again I don't know why I want to complain about this since it was only 17$ and it didn't advertise anything like Im describing so I knew that I couldn't do this when I bought it.

What I don't like about it is that the keyboard isn't as smooth to type on as other keyboards I have used but I knew there was a good chance that would be the case when I bought it because almost every keyboard I have ever used is different from the last and the way that the keys push/click is either exactly how I like it or it isn't. Even the keys on my 2012 macbook pro is different then the keys on my 2013 macbook pro (i prefer the 2012 one, but I'm sure thats just because I was so used to the 2012 one and have only been using the newer one for a couple of months. one of my favorite keyboards of all time is the good ole fashioned keyboard that has come with all Dell desktops since the millennium because thats the kind of keyboard i use at work and i used it forever growing up.

I was also hoping the mouse was a normal sized mouse but its the kind that is a little bit smaller (not like super small but I'm sure most people have or have used the kind I'm talking about on a friends computer).  Its pretty sensitive, but I do have my computer set to the highest sensitivity possible for my cursor so Im sure I could change that if I wanted to but, for me, this is a good thing because it allows me to do things quicker especially once I have used it for a while and I am accustomed to how sensitive it is.",Great Deal for 17$...I recommend,1406851200,

I find myself wishing that the keyboard keys were a bit more supple (more like laptop keys?) but are by no means stiff. The mouse works great and the attached micro USB worked without fail the first time I plugged it in. Even nicer was the fact that Logitech includes batteries in both the keyboard and the mouse so that you don't have to do that frantic scramble through the house to rustle up some double-A's. The batteries are prevented from discharging by a plastic pull-tab that you remove prior to the first use.

The box information states that the mouse and keyboard have an auto-off which is supposed to extend the battery life.

Now, more about the MK270.

My top positive (++) and negative (--) points on making this set my primary keyboard / mouse sets now :

+++ Having the Cursor movement keys / arrow keys in the ""inverted-T layout"" a little further to the makes using them much easier than on the MK320. Having the page up / page down keys -- in the style of a standard 104-key IBM PC (Windows, US layout) keyboard -- also makes them easier for me to use.

+++ Larger function keys (I gotta be able to use the ALT-F4 combo easily!) are easier to access, and a little greater distance from the top row on the keyboard prevents key selection errors.

++ this ""Unifying USB Receiver"" offers use with a greater variety of mice and keyboards.

+ slightly less expensive than the one I had already.

+ has a slightly smaller footprint than the MK320.

- (a slight minus) a slightly higher hand position in typing (but I've gotten over that already).

- (not an issue to me, but maybe others will) has fewer media keys available on the top row, but I don't use them...

If you like Logitech products, check the ""Which Logitech Keyboard and Mouse Combo Is Right For You?"" on the Product Description for the MK270 to see what features you need most.

I have both this model and the Microsoft Wireless 800 keyboard mouse combo.  Some differences are that the Logitech keyboard does not have a side border/bezel so it has a smaller perimeter than Microsoft's.  Logitech keyboard has an on/off switch but Microsoft's doesn't.  Logitech keyboard border texture is the same as the keys (the matte feeling) while Microsoft's border is very smooth and of different texture than the matte keys.  The natural angle of Logitech keyboard is flatter than Microsoft's.  Therefore with the extended legs, Logitech's keyboard is also still at a lower angle than Microsoft's.  Underside of Logitech keyboard is gray while underside of Microsoft keyboard is white.

I'm happy to report that this keyboard/mouse combo works like a charm with the Samsung PN60F8500 Smart TV.

Here's what I did and what happened:

1. Pulled out the battery keeper cardboard tabs from the keyboard and mouse and made sure both were switched on.

2. Plugged in the USB sender unit to a short USB extender/extension cable  and then plugged the extender into one of the USB ports on the back of the TV so the USB sender wouldn't be blocked by the TV body, thereby assuring a powerful line of sight signal between the sender and  the keyboard and mouse, because the distance these things are designed to operate is  pretty short compared to bluetooth, which BTW, I wasn't about to hassle with, because personally, I don't think bluetooth IN GENERAL is ready for prime time, nor will it ever be. Far better to utilize proprietary signalling between sender and device and reply on the fact that the Smart TV contains generic HID USB drivers.

3. After plugging in the extender cable/sender combo, the Smart TV immediately popped up messages recognizing both the keyboard and mouse. Perusing  the Device menu in the TV, shows  both the Logitech keyboard and the Logitech mouse as being recognized and connected.

4. I haven't yet done anything with the keyboard and mouse, and I know that not all TV apps will work with anything but the included Samsung app remote control, but I don't see any reason for this keyboard and mouse to function any less than any other keyboard and mouse, bluetooth or otherwise.

I've now had a chance to use the keyboard and mouse: they work fine. However, not sure how useful they are overall. Mouse is actually very good for operating the various TV settings menus as well as operation of the Smart Hub menus. A few keys on the keyboard like Esc, Return and the arrow keys do useful things, plus a few random function keys that have to be tried out trial and error. However, the apps themselves are a whole nother story. Keyboard basically only works with the primitive builtin browser and the mouse works with only a few of the apps. Neither work with the most important apps, namely netflix and amazon prime.",Works Great With Samsung Smart TV Model PN60F8500!,1404000000,

Couple of things to note.

-  It would have been nice if the keyboard came with media for installing Setpoint.  Or instructions to install Setpoint..  Or what Setpoint was.  (Setpoint is Logitech's config utility that allows you to do things like adjust the mouse sensitivity or reset the keyboard's hotkeys.  It is available from the Logitech web page).

-  The mouse is freaky small.  Easily half the size of my previous mouse.  It's a nice mouse and seems accurate and precise, but seems a bit small in the hand of an adult male human.

-  There is a row of  hotkeys at the top of the keyboard.  They are ""Home"", ""Email"", ""Power"", and ""Calculator"".  They work.  The nasty bit is that power button located right between Email and Calculator - the two hotkeys that I had anticipated using most frequently, or would have if it weren't for the risk of accidentally turning my computer off every time I reach for one.  Fortunately, the power button, doesn't so much power the computer off, as it puts it to sleep.  Note: The ""Power"" hotkey is not configurable via Setpoint.

1) The top row of keys has a PC power on/off button.  Great right?  Except when you move the keyboard in and out of reception that button seems to trigger the pc to turn on or off! So my pc occasionally shuts down or starts up when I move the keyboard.
2) Reception is a problem.  I had planned to sit in my recliner with my pc sitting next to the recliner and the keyboard in my lap. However the side of the recliner seems to block the keyboard from transmitting to the PC.  Further, I cannot use the mouse on the opposite side of the recliner.  We are talking about 2-3 feet at most.  I do believe it would meet its claim of 10 ft reception if it were in line of sight with the PC receiver.

They keyboard is full size, which is certainly a plus. The power switch is located on the top right corner making it easy to turn on and off without flipping it over. For power it uses two AAA batteries. The main complaints about the keyboard is the complete lack of indicators. There is only a single one, that being for the caps lock key. There are no indicators at all on if the keyboard is turned on, and no indication if num lock is on (or scroll lock for that mater).

The mouse is probably the most underwhelming of the pair. It is extremely light, and feels extremely cheap. It uses a single AA battery for power, and the power switch is located underneath. The power switch on mine is pretty poor, it's somewhat difficult to turn it on and off as the switch is recessed to keep the bottom of the mouse smooth, but it also moves inward when I try to slide it making it all the more difficult. Like the keyboard, there is no indication if the mouse is on or not, unlike every other mouse I've used the optical sensor does not use a red or blue LED but I'm guessing infrared since it isn't visible.

While I know indicators use power, the amount that an LED uses is really trivial. A typical AA battery can keep one illuminated for over 380 hours continuously for example. I have two other Microsoft mice that I use with laptops and both feature an LED on the top that lets you know if the battery is getting close to dying. These mice last over a month of daily use on their single AA battery which is sufficient.

Overall though, this mouse and keyboard combination does work, and I was happy that it worked well with my PS4. Extra indicators and a storage slot on either the keyboard or the mouse for the USB dongle would improve this product to 5 stars.",Barebones,1402617600,

Newell,"The idea of buying a keyboard and a mouse together as a combination deal sounds like it could be a money saver, and it is; buying the items separately would cost more for sure. But there are compromises.

The MK270 provides a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse. They run off a single USB port using a typical USB receiver. This is both good and bad. It's good because you only take up one USB port, but it's bad because you can't use the keyboard in one location and the mouse in another.

In my case, I ran out to Walmart to buy something on an emergency basis because the keyboard on my desktop failed. I figured fine, I didn't need the mouse but I can use it with a laptop. I should have looked more closely; you can't do that with only one USB receiver, and that's all you get in the package.

The keyboard, though, lives up to Logitech's highest standards. It's built solidly without being heavy or bulky; the ""touch"" on the keys feels just right, and it's really quiet. The keyboard has a full compliment of keys; there's a numeric keypad, and a series of auxiliary buttons along the top for changing volume, playing media, launching email, etc. The manufacturer advertises a two-year battery life; given that the keyboard has autosleep and an easily accessible on-off switch on the top, I find this a credible claim.

The mouse? Pretty average. It's ambidextrous--- you can use it with either hand. It's comfortable enough, it tracks well in ordinary use (although it's hardly a gaming mouse at this price), and it has a scroll wheel. The biggest issues? It's light and flimsy, and it only has two buttons. So this is a very basic, close to low-end mouse.

There are the barest minimum of instructions, but really, how much of an instruction book do you need with a keyboard and mouse?

What's my bottom line on the package? At the price you can get it for on Amazon, it's worth it for the keyboard alone and if you're not fussy about mice, the mouse is a usable extra. So I'd have to say that the package is an outstanding deal and I have no trouble recommending it. I completely love the keyboard.

One thing to note: I'm in Honolulu, where prices are higher than on the mainland, and buying this at Walmart cost me TWICE what it would have cost to buy it from Amazon. That's what happens when you need a keyboard NOW and can't wait 10 days for shipping from the mainland.","The keyboard is fantastic, the mouse not so much",1402272000,

The keyboard works as well as any other Logitech keyboard-- comfortable size; keys, smooth and easy to press.  It's smaller than other keyboards and wireless so it's easy to set aside to make room for other activities.  Since I'm not using Razer Synapse, I actually prefer this over my Razer Deathstalker... I would miss the backlit keys, though.
The included mouse is rather small but usable-- feels good with a fingertip grip.  It lacks the five buttons I've grown accustomed to.  Its small size and light weight is a definite plus if you're taking it along with a laptop, netbook, ultrabook, etc. But since I don't plan on taking my desktop anywhere, I'll set it aside and use the M510 I've had for so long.

As you can imagine this is a pain if the reason you buy a device is so you don't have to do that.

At this point, I'd rather buy a male-male USB cord and some couplers for a wired keyboard than continue using this. The functionality isn't there when I need it to be there. It can't simply work 80% of the time.

The mouse does that same sort of thing. It will just stop tracking occasionally. So there is clearly some sort of interference going on I suppose. This is the only wireless device other than my laptop and phone (of course) in the vicinity.

I have a K270 keyboard (that I love) which works with the Logitech unifying receiver, and when I saw this MK270 combo for much cheaper than the K270 alone, I thought I found myself a great deal. However, that's not the case.

The keyboard that comes with the MK270 is not the same as the K270, though they look the same. The differences are:
- MK270 keyboard has light grey trim and back. The K270 has white trim and back
- MK270 only works with the non-nano USB transmitter that comes with it. It is not compatible with the unifying receiver. The K270 comes with a nano unifying receiver, and works with other unifying receivers.
- Both have a matte plastic finish, but the MK270 has a more rough matte finish. I like the MK270 keyboard better for this, since the matte finish on the K270 started becoming shiny within a few months on the frequently used keys and the MK270 looks like it will hold on to its matte finish for longer.

Pros:
1. Great typing experience.
2. Matte finish, which is important for me since I use additional lighting around my PC and don't like it shining off my keyboard.
3. Compact size, while still having a full keyboard layout. Includes volume buttons and a few macro keys. I don't typically use macro keys.
4. On-off switch at the top
5. Caps lock indicator! Too many keyboards in this compact size range leave out the caps lock indicator.
6. Inexpensive.
7. Batteries seem to last forever.
8. I've only used the keyboard in close range, but I've used it for over a year now and have never had interference. I live in a high rise, so interference can frequently be a problem.

Cons:
1. Mouse is too light, doesn't look good, and doesn't have Logitech's signature metal-edge scroll wheel. I wasn't intending to use it anyway.
2. Does not work with Logitech's unifying receiver. This means I need to use one transmitter for the keyboard and another for my mouse, the Logitech Marathon Mouse M705.
3. Lettering on the keyboard uses dated fonts and doesn't look sharp.
4. No wrist pad. I use 2 3M 6.9-inch gel wrist pads. This works great for me while taking up very little desk real estate.

Overall, I love this keyboard. For the price, I can ignore the shortcomings of the mouse and simply not use it, leaving the keyboard with a 5-star rating.","Keyboard is perfect, mouse is not, not compatible with unifying receiver",1400371200,

If you can get it for that price, this is an outstanding basic keyboard. Don't expect to pull any miracles of gaming on this, it's simply designed for those who want a wireless keyboard at home and don't want to break the bank doing so.

The biggest concern people have (and the reason for the docking of one star) is mainly due to the flimsy nature of keyboard. It's not a keyboard you would want on your lap. It's one you want to keep on the desk.

Yes, the keyboard is full size. But the materials used in it aren't of a very high strength polycarbonate. It's more like a cheap plastic. I was able to twist the keyboard a good amount before stopping out of fear of breaking the thing. This is just due to the design of the keyboard.

This keyboard not passing the ""laugh test"" in any office a couple decades ago, when the average customer had greater performance expectations.

PROs:

i) Other than the space, enter and backspace keys which make a sharp clicking-taping noise upon bottoming out, the keys on the MK270 keyboard are quite, though not as quite as the K340 keyboard.

ii) Very inexpensive product and perhaps ideal for elementary school environments.

Suitable for graduates and oficiandos of Tw! tter literature.

CONs:

Keyboard

i) The MK270 keyboard is smaller than the K340, the K340 already smaller than full size. Thus, coming from the K340 am making many typing errors, striking two keys at a time, my hand slightly smaller than average in the USA.

ii)The MK270 keyboard is not well designed for lap use and ridiculous being a cordless keyboard. The keyboard constantly slipping off the left leg as there is not enough keyboard. The keyboard does not have any rubber pads to coincide with one's right leg thus sliding off the knee. Only a tunnel vision manager, or bonus chaser approving this minimalist design keyboard and one best left for desk use.

iii) Unlike the K340 keyboard, the LED for the caps lock key on the MK270 is not on the caps lock key. Instead the LED is located at the far right where one would not tend to be looking for key stroke confirmation, resulting in an unnecessary neck turn.

iv) The MK270 keyboard, unlike the MK340 though slippery, has nowhere to grab the device from the left side should you wish to place it besides the computer or next to the desk leg, and not much better on the right side having just the upper right hand corner to grab. This being a function of Logitech wishing to save too much material, packaging volume and generally indifferent to the end users experience.

v) The keyboard itself has a very weak frame compared to the K340 and twists easily or worst sags in the middle when typing along the upper row of keys when elevated (tilted) at the back by the rear lift tabs on the underside.

Mouse

vi) The MK270 mouse has a very low profile (minimize the volume) and for that reason, unlike my Microsoft 3500 mouse, the heal of my palm slides across the surface of the desk aggravating my preexisting mouse induced callous and sore tendons. The callous at one point growing larger from using a Logitech MX Anywhere mouse that has many of the same low profile induced ergonomic flaws as the mouse that come with the MK270 set. In addition, the MK270 mouse being very narrow at the tail end, along with low profile compounding the little support issue for the palm.

vii) The location of the apex (high point) on the MK270 mouse is too far center, thus my palms slips off the back of the mouse too easily. For that reason, need to keep my shoulder tense to keep the heal of my palm from dragging on the desk surface.

viii) The laser at the bottom of the MK270 mouse, like the Microsoft 3500 mouse, is not centered as is that on my MX Anywhere and MS Bluetooth mouse. Hence, the laser is not resting over the area of the surface one expects.

ix) The weight (mass) of the mouse with single battery being too little at 74 grams and far too easy to bump, the MX mouse with twin battery weighing a more substantive 130 grams. The MS 3500 mouse being slightly heavier than the MK270 mouse, at 89 grams.

x) The friction pads, like those on the MX mouse are too noisy and perhaps twice as noisy a mouse on the desk relative to the Microsoft 3500 mouse. After just one hour of use, showing wear.

xi) The loud and harsh click produced by the mouse is about as loud and disruptive in a quite room as the MS 3500 mouse, both being noisier than the MS Bluetooth travel mouse much louder than the Logitech MX mouse with its very soft clicking sound.

xii) The battery cover on the mouse slips off much too easily making no secure latching like sensation upon closure.

xiii) The scroll wheel has a very low quality indent sensation and sloppy relative to the scroll wheel on my MS 3500 mouse. The scroll wheels being used by Logitech continually getting lower in quality and build with each new product generation.

The leadership, if one could even call it that, managing Logitech being focused on the wrong end of the horse.

In short, those that find this product to be anything but marginal at best, have yet to use a quality keyboard and mouse combination.

Minus 0.5 for a mechanically weak keyboard frame.
Minus 0.25 for not being well suited of lap use and few grab points.
Minus 0.25 for less than ideal location of the Caps Lock LED indicator.
Minus 0.5 for the low quality switches and scroll wheel selected for the mouse.
Minus 0.25 for the very low profile and poor ergonomics of the mouse.
Minus 0.25 for noisy low friction pads and cheap battery cover design.","Designed to Inspire the Shareholder, not End User - Compairsons with K340 Keyboard, MX Anywhere and MS 3500 Mouse",1399334400,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rx-F24SwL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61M0MPYxJXL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51I-q+BmulL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61BdD7TDu6L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511vGTr+q8L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oe2BpleVL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51n3xCy-sEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SEQ4FXFEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iob81YZmL._SY88.jpg']"

And, I have to say, I got a different keyboard from another, well-known source in computers, since I didn't want to take the chance of the two keyboards and mice interfering with each other, and this one if far superior to the other; the keyboard, especially.  The letters and numbers just jump out at you, even in subdued light, unlike the other one. Mouse function is better too--more reliable on varying surfaces.

I am adding this on 4/20/14.  I still mostly love this M-K combination; however, I thought the mouse had broken a couple of days ago.  When this happened, the keyboard also failed to bring up Task Manager with CNT-ALT-DEL, and the computer was frozen necessitating a shut down with the power button.  So, today, I called Logitech and found that it still works just fine on my Windows 7 Ultimate machine (and earlier versions of Windows), but the Logitech HELP guy told me this combination does have issues with Windows 8.1 (I'm running 8.1 Pro) which still have yet to be solved.  There is still no software update that will solve these issues.  I used it for over a month with no problem on my 8.1 PC, and I like it a lot more than the MS K-M combination I also have; but it's now relegated to my older 7 Ultimate computer until there is a software fix.  So maybe it SHOULD work just fine with 8.1 since the mouse/keyboard interfaces use relatively little data processing capability; but, as of this date, it could cause a freeze on any 8.1 machine and remain useless thereafter with that computer until a software fix for 8.1 systems is produced by Logitech.

The price was right for a wireless keyboard and mouse set.

It has a tiny little transmitter that plugs into a USB port. It sticks out only about 1/4"". It worked flawlessly right out of the box.

Cons:

The keys seem cramped. My fingers get fatigued after just a little typing. I have to apply a fair amount of pressure on the keys which don't give me the kind of feedback that even my cheap Microsoft keyboard did. Basically, it isn't comfortable to use.

It is too light to stay put on my desk. It really needs a little more heft to it to keep it from sliding.

Build quality is surprisingly good - keyboard not too flexy and both it and the mouse have perfect weight. Plastic is more rubbery than brittle. The mouse doesn't need a pad to track (even works on clear glass or my leg) and isn't too small even for my large male hands. Mouse also has a dongle storage-slot for travel.

Wireless range is super long. I can go anywhere in my room (30 x 30 ft) and it works. I do have the included extender installed (it's just a USB adapter that protrudes the dongle 2 inches from the computer).

Mouse and keyboard never need to be turned off to save batteries.  There are several reviews claiming almost a year of battery life without the hassle of switching the power button off every night.

Product works right out of the box (no driver install), however, the mouse pointer was factory set at extremely fast and the only way to slow it down is downloading the free SetPoint software from the Logitech website. This also allows you to customize the shortcut keys and disable that damned ""Caps Lock"" key - halleluiah!!!

My biggest complaint about this was the keyboard arrived not working.  I figured out that I just had to bend the positive battery terminal a little so it touched the edge of the battery.

It has a standard key layout, including a numeric key pad.  It makes tiny clicking noises when you type on it and I can't imagine the slight noise would bother anyone unless someone was sleeping a few feet from away you while you were using it.  The mini USB plug fits in a port in my tower and just about disappears.  Plug it in and forget about it.  There's no chance of brushing past it with your arm while reaching for something on the shelf above the tower and knocking into it, thus risking breaking it.  And I can type my usual 80 to 90 wpm on it with no problem.  No lag time at all.

I use this keyboard with Windows 7 on a desktop.  Whenever you click on ""Caps Lock, Windows 7 puts a notification on the screen saying whether Caps Lock is on or off.  Which brings me to the only thing I can find wrong with the MK270.  Next to the on/off switch on the top right hand of the keyboard is a Caps Lock light under a small ""A.""  When I put Caps Lock on, it should light up green.  But it doesn't.  It lights up green, signalling that Caps Lock is on, when I turn Caps Lock OFF!  Being a total non-techie, I have no idea why this is, but it doesn't bother me since I'm used to looking for the on-screen notification.  Whether or not it would misbehave in this fashion on any other computer, I don't know.  But I would imagine that if it did you get used to the green light being lit meaning Caps Lock is off.

And that on/off switch on the TOP of the keyboard, in such a convenient place, makes it a cinch to take the extra second to turn the keyboard off when you're not going to be using it for several hours or more.  I would definitely recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for a simple design, and a standard keyboard layout with no extra bells and whistles other than 8 keys at the top including Home Page, calculator, volume controls, email--and two more I haven't tried yet so I don't know what they do.

The keyboard is basic, it doesn't have the bells and whistles and extras of more expensive kb's but I knew that and really didn't want or need them because I don't use them. The keys strike firm and are responsive, and have a gentle concave shape that I can feel beneath my fingertips while typing. The contrast on the keys is also nice, bright white letters and numbers on a dull finished black so they are easy to see in a lower light.

The mouse isn't quite full size but it isn't a mini-type laptop mouse either. It's ambidextrous and comfortable and has a tilt wheel that allows for scrolling left and right on larger, not fully displayed pages.

Long story short, I should have gotten a different model instead of the MK270. Prior to this purchase, I helped a friend get the MK260 and being how this one is a newer model, I chose this one instead.

First the keyboard. This is not your standard sized keyboard. It is definitely smaller. Depending on your desk/keyboard tray area, this may or may not be a good thing. Personally, I am OK with it. The keyboard measures 17.2 inches by 5.7 inches. They keys are fairly quiet when typing and there are some standard buttons at the top that helps you execute some common tasks such as volume control, mute, sleeping the PC and menu button. There is actually an Off/On power switch in the upper right corner of the keyboard. I personally have no use for turning off my keyboard but I'm sure a small percentage of users out there would use this function.

Now onto the mouse. Simply said, I hate it. It has an identity crisis. It seems as if Logitech didn't know whether to make the mouse for the MK270 a portable mouse or a full size mouse. Therefore, they made it ""in-between"". The result is a very uncomfortable mouse to use and I have fairly small hands. It's not as big as your standard mouses but yet it's not small enough to be considered a portable mouse. When I tried the mouse on the MK260, that mouse was perfect. It was sized like an actual standard mouse. Also, the mouse on the MK270 is actually heavier than the bigger mouse of the MK260! As of right now, I am sticking with my trusty USB mouse (again, from Logitech) that I have been using for the past 6-7 years. This does make it odd since I wanted to go all wireless but the mouse just killed it for me. This probably is a non-issue for many but in my opinion, since you'll be using the mouse exclusively each and every time you use your computer, it better well be comfortable to use!","Good Keyboard, Horrible Mouse",1375574400,

However, if you're looking for a wireless keyboard+mouse solution that gets the job done, the MK270 absolutely works.  The small nano-receiver fits into any USB port and doesn't take up any space, so you can still plug in bulky flash drives into the USB slots next to it.  The keyboard and mouse both have easy access power buttons that allow you to shut them down at the end of the day to save battery juice.  The keyboard keys travel a satisfying distance with each stroke for good accuracy, and they produce a comforting amount of clicky noise.  There are a couple dedicated buttons at the top of the keyboard to control media functions and launch email, but there's not a lot extra happening with this keyboard.

The minimalistic mouse is cut from the same cloth as the keyboard.  It simply gets the job done.  The accuracy on the mouse is sufficient for web browsing and typical Office work, however, it is not a laser mouse.  So if you want pixel perfect movements for video games or Photoshop, you'll want something with a little better tracking.

The MK270 also lacks the built-in ergonomic wrist rest of the MK550, so you might want to consider buying a wrist rest pad to complement the MK270 if you're using it for extended time periods.  But if you have a computer hooked up to your TV and need a cheap keyboard to use on the couch, this works like a champ.  One final thing to note, if you're buying this for light usage (which should be the targeted use), I recommend simply plugging in the receiver and typing away.  For anything more than light usage, I recommend going to the Logitech website and downloading the SetPoint software to gain some functionality and customization options for the combo unit.  It takes up a little extra RAM as the trade-off, but it's worth it for medium-to-heavy users.

In summary, the MK270 is a perfect, low-cost combo solution for people that need a wireless keyboard and mouse for less than 1-3 consecutive hours of daily light usage. Hence my five star rating above. If you're planning on using this combo unit for a daily, full work day, then you should think of it as a 3-star product.",A useable low-cost wireless combo,1374624000,

However, the full set of keys in a small form factor makes it an ideal set for carrying around to use with your laptop, as it is a far superior keyboard to most built-in laptop keyboards. The mouse is also just average in form factor. This set does have a Unifying USB connector, so you could replace the mouse with a nicer Logitech mouse if you wish. Having a convenient sized traveling wireless keyboard is alone well worth the price of this set.

Although I haven't had this set for long to test the battery life, I have used Logitech wireless mice and keyboard sets for many years. Their claims about extremely long battery life for just normal batteries in their mice and keyboards is absolutely accurate.

LIKES:
+ Works great paired with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-TC-L50E60-50-Inch-1080p-120Hz-Smart-LED-HDTV/dp/B00B59NX9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic TC-L50E60 50-Inch 1080p 120Hz Smart LED HDTV</a>&nbsp;(and probably with other Smart TVs that support a wireless a keyboard and mouse, but check your user manual).  Using a keyboard and mouse with my Smart TV's built-in web browser makes couch surfing so much easier!
+ Both the keyboard and mouse have on/off switches to conserve battery power. Nice!
+ Keyboard media buttons.  These are located across the top left of the keyboard.  Using on my desktop, I love these for one-button access to my email program and web browser especially.  The media buttons also can play/pause a song in iTunes, turn the speaker volume up/down/mute, open calculator, and power off my pc.  TIP: Beware the last one because it *will* shut down/hibernate your pc without asking for confirmation!
+ Full size keyboard with numerical keypad.  It feels nice to type on; standard full size keys means I had no issues transitioning from my other keyboard.
+ The 2.4Ghz wireless receiver is tiny and unobtrusive. When not in use, it can store in the bottom of the mouse, under the battery cover.
+ Plug and play.  Just plug in the receiver, add batteries to the keyboard and mouse, and you're done.
+ The keyboard has tilt legs you can flip if you prefer an angle.  There is no palm rest, however.

MIDDLE OF THE ROAD:
* Mouse is lightweight and tiny, more like a travel mouse than a desktop mouse. It also feels sort of cheap in my hand.  It is labeled on the bottom as a M185, and is roughly the size and shape of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Wireless-Mouse-M325-with-Designed-For-Web-Scrolling-Light-Silver-910-002332/dp/B005DSPLDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Wireless Mouse M325 with Designed-For-Web Scrolling - Light Silver (910-002332)</a>&nbsp;that I carry in my laptop bag, although not as well made. The mouse does have a ""click"" scroll wheel like other Logitech mice.
* For use on a desktop pc, there is no way to customize the media buttons from their defaults. Being able to customize the buttons to open the programs I wanted (such as Word) would have been a big plus.

DISLIKE:
- I think the placement of the ""pc power off"" button on the media controls is awkward. It's right next to the ""open email"" button.  More than once, I've hit it by accident and instead of opening my email as intended, I've put my pc into hibernation/shutdown.  Annoying.  IMO, the ""pc power off"" button should be on the end of the row where the ""open calculator"" one sits, and where I'm less likely to turn off my pc by mistake.

OVERALL:
Overall, this is good basic keyboard/mouse wireless combo for entry level.  As an addition to my Panasonic Smart TV, I can't see that I would want anything more ie: I have no use for the numerical pad or media buttons with the Smart TV.  For the pc desktop, because of what I find to be an awkward and annoying placement of the ""pc power off"" button, I think I'd personally be tempted to step up to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Wireless-Desktop-MK320-Keyboard/dp/B003VAGXZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Wireless Desktop MK320 Keyboard</a>&nbsp;for just a couple bucks more.","Basic wireless desktop combo, also works with my Smart TV",1373846400,

The keyboard and the mouse both works perfectly right out of the box, with no CD/software/drivers needed.  I need to give Logitech two thumbs up for not only  allowing both keyboard and mouse to share one single usb receiver, but for making the USB receiver extremely small.  The size of the receiver makes a big difference in that you don't have to worry about a big piece of receiver sticking out of the side of your laptop, or accidentally break the receiver because it sticks out in front of your tower.

The 10 meter range wireless connection is extremely reliable.  We enjoy watching Netflix & Hulu Plus on our TV, but the TV is in our bedroom and the computer is in another room.  I can now bring the mouse to our bedroom, and still have perfect mouse control while enjoying our shows.

What I like best is that it's light, responsive, easy to set up, easy to turn on and off.

What I don't like is the mouse's responsiveness without a mouse pad.  With a mouse pad it's awesome.  Without one, it's uneven in terms of response speed.

I have used Logitech wireless keyboards and mice exclusively for the past 5 years, and always found their products to be excellent in terms of usability and reliability.  This budget-priced set is no different.

The MK270 combo comes with a wireless keyboard, wireless mouse and two unifying receivers which connect to USB ports on your desktop or laptop.  One of the receivers is the size of a flash drive, and the other is much smaller (easy to lose if you're not careful).

This keyboard and mouse are plug and play - no drivers to install and up and running in minutes.  BTW... If you are using an older version of Windows (XP or Vista) a restart after installation is always recommended to make a solid connection with wireless devices.

The keyboard is full-sized, offering a numeric keyboard and programmable Home and email buttons.  Buttons to control your PC's sound (mute, volume up n' down, an dplay) as well as a calculator and power on/off for the PC are at the top of the keyboard controls.

The greatest selling point for this combo is its budget retail price, with its long battery life for both the keyboard and mouse being a close second.  Up to 2 years of life for the keyboard, and up to 1 year on the mouse, per battery installation.

The keyboard is comfortable to type on, with just enough key-play to make me happy.  Some keyboards are too shallow (keys aren't tall enough) or you have to press too hard to activate the keys, but this is 'just right' for me.

The mouse is a travel size mouse.  Meaning, if you have big hands, you may not like this one.  I have very small hands, and it fits perfectly in them, yet I still prefer another mouse.  I use this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Wireless-Performance-Mouse-MX-for-PC-and-Mac/dp/B002HWRJBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Mac</a>, for the way it feels and its added features. I will keep the MK270 with my laptop and the keyboard with my desktop.

Which reminds me... even though it's sold as a set, you can break it up and use the mouse or the keyboard separately on different PC's or with a device like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Revue-with-Google-TV-Refurbished/dp/B006HFVXSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Revue with Google TV (Refurbished)</a>.

The unifyinng Logitech receivers that come with this product will also allow you to connect other Logitech accessories using the same receiver.  That's really handy if you have other compatible devices, or like me, find yourself switching out one mouse for the other.

There is a 3 year limited hardware warranty with this product and it works with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and RT.

I wish the keyboard had backlighting, but considering it's price point, this was not expected.

2.4GHz wireless connections are reliable as long as the batteries are good.  If you have issues out of the box, swap out the included batteries for some new ones and you should be good to go.

Overall, this is a good choice for basic PC users including students, business and home users.

I tested this on a Toshiba laptop and it worked instantly. Like the full-size keyboard for math and other functions, so it's nice to see all the extra keys where you expect them. (Are you listening, Apple?)

The keys are rather quiet and while not as easily adapted to (since we're all getting trained on a flat keyboard these days) they are still a good example of a mid-2000s keyboard at it's best. This is not a major advancement in keyboards, however, and I was sort of surprised at the lack of ergonomics with this unit. I guess for under 30 dollars, however, this would be a great replacement for a kids computer or other mid-level computer system.

The color is a nice dark charcoal and the white letters look like they'd last a good long time.  The mouse is quite comfortable (In my book, Logitech does make the best mouse) and feels good in your hand. Both buttons work well and it's programmable depending on your system software.

A slick-looking keyboard which is still a bit behind on ergonomics (split keyboard, lower keys, etc.).  I give it 4 stars... holding one back for that futuristic advancement I was hoping for.","Works Well, Long Life, Few Ergonomics",1372291200,
3234001,4.0,2,False,"06 27, 2013",A2PK64OVZA1U8Z,B00BP5KOPA,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},Jakester,"There's a lot to like about this combo from Logitech. First, the high points.
1. The keyboard and mouse come with batteries pre-installed (2xAAA for keyboard, AA for mouse). All you have to do is pull out the plastic tab to activate them. The box promises 24 months for the keyboard and 12 months for the mouse before requiring battery replacement. This is probably accurate except that both devices have an on/off switch so those timeframes probably assume you remember to turn off your mouse and keyboard when shutting down your PC.
2. The keyboard has a solid feel and good tactile response on the keys. Qwerty standard layout with small kickstands to elevate the back of the keyboard.
3. The capslock key lights a light on the keyboard, something I personally find handy.
4. The 2.4 ghz USB receiver works in both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0. In fact I'm typing this on the keyboard with the receive plugged into a USB 3.0 hub. My OS is Windows 8.
5. Comes with a USB Unifying plug. It's a plug with a male plug on one end and female on the other and is about 2 inches long when plugged into a port. You can use this to unify any existing Logitech wireless devices you might already have installed on your PC.

The not so high points:
1. The installation of the drivers required a reboot of my PC. No biggie really but seems unusual compared to recent installs.
2. Mouse is small and feels cheap. The size of the mouse is akin to a laptop mouse and feels too small to use on a daily basis. It's also light plastic and just doesn't feel that solid. I would use it for a portable system but not for day to day.
3. Turning on the Numlock key does not light a light on the keyboard. I find this type of light to be regularly useful and am surprised it's not included as it's standard with almost every other keyboard I use.

Overall this is a very nice keyboard and OK mouse and an especially good deal at this price point. Recommended.","Excellent keyboard, so-so mouse",1372291200,

Logitech even had the batteries already installed, all I had to do was remove a bit of plastic which was easily marked that was there to keep the batteries from draining.  I wanted a full sized keyboard with number pad, and that's exactly what this is.  I found the keyboard to be very responsive, as well as the mouse.  I also like the size of the mouse, which isn't big and bulky like some others that I've used.

The wireless receiver supports both the keyboard and mouse to fill only one USB port and it works just fine from a hub.  There is a range extender included for the receiver for use with a desktop PC although I'm not sure when it would be necessary.  Everything is plug & play and hot-swappable:  receiver, keyboard, mouse.

The keyboard has large keys that travel well and it is very comfortable for typing.  It has a row of special function keys across the top for volume, etc. that are designed for Windows but the basic keyboard works just fine with my Mac as well.  The on-off switch is conveniently placed on the top right rather than underneath or on the edge.

The extendable feet are very flimsy and have no padding so they would scratch a wood desk or table.  When flat, the keyboard is supported by five rubbery feet, including one below the space bar.

There is a numeric keypad on the right which some people find indispensable.  However, I have gotten used to laptop-style keyboards and find that this is not only a waste of valuable desk space but that it makes the keyboard extend so far to the right that using the mouse is awkward.  (Total width is 17 3/8 in.)

The mouse functions quite well and is very precise but is a generic design and is on the small side at 3 3/4 in. long and I prefer a larger, more ergonomic mouse.  It has the handy little storage receptacle for the wireless receiver in the battery compartment and the on-off switch is underneath as well.

I suggest proactively buying the rechargeable Sanyo Eneloop batteries to have on hand as replacements for the generic alkalines that are included because they will stop working without warning.  The keyboard uses two AAAs and the mouse uses only one AA rather than two AAs as the Amazon listing states.

This Logitech Wireless Combo MK270 with Keyboard and Mouse works as described. Set up is easy, and it performs fine. The mouse is somewhat low grade, but still usable. I could safely say that if you purchased this you would be satisfied with the product. I replaced the wired keyboard and mouse on a secondary computer I have with the MK270 and am pleased with the upgrade.

However, I use a Logitech Illuminated Ultrathin Keyboard with Backlighting on my main computer and really find it to be a GREAT product. It is not wireless but the quality (and price) are of much higher grade than the MK270. I would say that even though this device (MK270) is a very good unit, I would recommend spending a little more and getting the Logitech Wireless Combo MK520 With Keyboard and Laser Mouse. It costs only a little more but has much better design and features. It is closer in design to the Ultrathin that I use (but no backlight).

And as a final note, as some others have mentioned make sure you go to Logitech's web site and download the free SetPoint drivers and software. It gives you a lot of monitoring features (battery life, cap lock notification and more) that are useful.

This is a very good package, another quality product from Logitech. You would be fine in purchasing this, but I really would encourage you to go with the MK520 if you were thinking of purchasing a device like this.
